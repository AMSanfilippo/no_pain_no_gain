this past weekend was my wife and my favourite marathon the kaapsehoop marathon this race starts in a small village on top of a hill always hidden in the mist and runs down to nelspruit in mpumalanga south africa we have run this race now for three years

the goals for each of us were quite different i was aiming for a comfortable 0430 while she was hoping to crack her first sub fivehour marathon last year she went under five on her watch but because she spent a good five minutes stopped to talk to friends on the side of the road and with autopause turned on her watch she thought she came in at 0458 but officially it was a 0503

early we set off in the mist for the past two years that we’ve run this marathon wild horses have galloped among us runners although this is quite beautiful it’s hair raising too this year we only saw the horses nonchalantly grazing at a distance 

the course runs on a forestry plantation road for the first few kilometers and then turns around to join up with another road taking us to the finish at kaapsehoop nearing the turn at 5ish kilometers in my wife was running just meters behind me this made me quite concerned that she was going out way too hard i was on pace for the 430 so she was already well under pace 

and that was the last that i saw of her during this race

the rest of the run was incredible mpumalanga the province where the race is run is one of the most beautiful in south africa and each turn in the road reveals the most astounding landscapes 

at halfway i was just under my expected pace a 212 but i knew that there was a hill toward the end that i was planning on walking so i still had the 430 under control i remember thinking at that stage my wife should be a little over ten minutes behind now

she wasn’t

although i think kaapsehoop is my favourite marathon it’s the hardest one that i run each year the downhills make it quick but it hurts my quads and i inevitable will hit the wall at some stage

this year was different i ran very easily until late in the race my pace remained the same and i felt so confident that i actually stopped looking at my watch after a while i did at one stage think about picking up the pace but my legs gave a little squeal when i suggested it so i resumed with my regular pace

a few times during the race i was concerned for my wife she has a habit of going out too hard and when i saw her earlier she looked ‘too good’ 

the final hill starts at 39km in and my plan from the start was to walk the whole way i knew that i would lose at least 3 minutes but if i had enough time banked this would be okay 

the race finishes at mbombela stadium one of the stadiums that hosted the 2010 soccer world cup i walked a little to take photographs on the finish straight and finished comfortably in 428

i then walked slowly back along the course to watch my wife finish when i heard one of our clubmates shouting ‘hey did you see charleen she finished so strong’ for a second i thought he must have it wrong she’s never cracked 5 and the time now isn’t even 435 he insisted i should go look at the tent and promised that i would find her there

so there she was with a big smile on her face she finished just under a minute behind me turns out looking later at the strava flybys that we ran the whole way together without even realising it the furthest that we were apart was four minutes and at times the gap was down to 40 seconds 
 
if i just ran a little slower in one section or her a little quicker on another we would have been able to run together but she assumed i was way ahead and i assumed she was well behind

she beat her pb by over 34 minutes

edit thanks everyone for all the support this sub is just incredible and i love sharing our stories with everyone ive been reading all the comments to my wife and shes very appreciative

training

i started training in january following my own plan that consisted of 1 long run per week progressively increasing mileage each week until hitting 12 miles then tapering back down to 8 the week before the race as well as 2 orange theory classes and 2 shorter 45 miles runs per week going into the race i felt adequately prepped and was averaging about 910  920 pace on my long runs

x200b

prerace

the night before we slept at my parents in the city so we didnt have to drive and park my kids 2 and 5 kept us up all night and i got about 3 solid hours of sleep between my son wetting the bed and the middle of the night tantrums because i wouldnt sleep in my daughters sleeping bag with her kids are great the morning of i woke up around 530 had a coffee and a banana right before the race i gobbled down some gatorade chews looking back i wish i had drank more water prerace but the last thing i wanted to do was stop to pee midrace

x200b

race

honestly the race was much harder than i expected it to be and a much harder perceived effort than any of my training runs im still trying to figure out why ive trained in snow and rain ive trained hungover on hills through injuries but for some reason race day proved harder than anticipated regardless i had such a good time and am so proud of myself for finishing 131 miles if you would have asked my 5 years ago if id ever run a half marathon i would have laughed in your face so this was a true accomplishment for me

x200b

miles 1 to 5

the first 45 miles were through the cityflat and fast i think this is where i made the biggest mistake contributing to not reaching my time goal as i paced too fast here i know better but still the excitement of my first half and all the people cheering got to me and a paced ahead leaving less in the tank for the later hillier miles one cool bonus about this portion of the race is that i ran into one of my best friends in the crowds i would have been nice to see her later in the race though when motivation was low 

x200b

miles 6 to 10

i was able to keep true to my goal pace more or less here but around mile 78 there was a huge hill which i knew aboutbut knowing about it ahead of time didnt make it any easier lol this was about the time the rain started in general running in the rain doesnt bother me so i welcomed the cool off 

x200b

miles 10 to 131

this is where i fell off as you can see by my splits again i dont really have an answer to why other than my hip began to bother me ive had on and off pain for weeks my calves were cramping a bit and again i started off too strong on the first 5 miles i just simply felt like i ran out of energy even though i popped gatorade chews at mile 6 and nuun along the way  i honestly felt like i wasnt going to finish at a few points during these last few miles by mile 13 i was 97 convinced id have to walk across the finish line but somehow i made it through at a jog a slow jog but a jog nonetheless

x200b

whats next

next up  broad street 10 miler on may 5th with a goal of beating my previous pr of 12802

next half not on the books yet but already antsy to run another one you all understand the running addiction i am sure any suggestions for cool fall halfs in the panjdemd area

x200b

thanks to all of you for being such awesome motivation for me as i trained for my first half 3

 pretraining

back in 2015 i moved cities for work and realised i was fat and miserable  these are understatements  i had a bmi of 45 and was struggling so much with my mental health that simply leaving my flat was incredibly hard to do  i decided that fixing being fat would be easier than fixing being sad so did some googling about how to lose weight and discovered it was free to calorie count so cracked on with that

x200b

it was not easy although it is simple  losing weight is about denial  in the same way ill tell my toddler cousins not to touch the stove i have to tell myself that the food i want is not actually good for me  but slowly the weight chipped off  during this i plucked up the courage to go to my gp and ask for help and then tell my family i was struggling and then some friends  it was harder than any other thing i will ever do  i was put on quite a lot of medication and into therapy and group sessions and as my weight dropped my coping mechanisms improved 

x200b

i started running in january 2016 at a bmi of 40  id lost 50lb by then  i started couch to 5k and then ran my first 5k in april that year in just under an hour  i was over the moon and immediately cracked on with building up to a 10k i didnt are about speed running was making me fall in love with my body in a way i had never been before  because weightloss isnt pretty  i have lots of loose skin and lots of insecurities over it  but running showed me my body was amazing  i can ask it to do mad things and it tries i put it through so much and all i get is yet more effort  

x200b

anyway  thats the backstory  i now have a bmi of 23 or so and im actually off all mental health related medications   so goals have been achieved  i am no longer always fat and miserable

x200b

 training

i am in a running club and my level leader put together a plan for me  it almost immediately began falling apart as i went through about 4 health issues in quick succession  but by midjanuary i had all sorts of prescriptions to my name and i was regaining some functionality  i managed to do long runs of 14 miles 16 miles 18 miles and 20 miles a half marathon and a 20 mile race in the run up and although i didnt think id be fast i felt secure in my 5 hour goal being achievable  based on my half marathon time i also set a second goal of 4 hour 41 minutes  but all i really wanted to do was finish an not cry til i was away from any photographers

x200b

 prerace

nervous wreck that is all  i hate pasta too and have spent 4 years on a deficit so trying to eat at maintenance during the taper really messed my head   but potatoes and bagels are life and i got through it  

x200b

i decided to start with the 445 pacer and see how i felt at mile 20 and try and kick on for my stretch goal   for me the starting crowd was a lot so having someone to focus on and follow made it less overwhelming  i also met some lovely ladies who heard it was my first and immediately took me under their wing and told me how amazing id be  loved them and they made a hard situation a lot easier

x200b

 miles 1 to 5

the pacer was amazing and i loved him  he was essentially running a party and everyone was invited  the first 5 miles just flew by and i felt so good and happy  stopped through a water station and then carried on and just everything felt so good

x200b

 miles 6 to 10

i found myself pulling away from the pace group  i kept slowing down again but my legs wanted me to roll on and so i did  i got a bit of a cramp in my hip at mile 7 but told it no and kept trucking on  the pain went away so i refused to dwell on it but focused a bit more on running well

x200b

i didnt really chat on this race  normally i like a good natter but i was so busy taking in the crowds and the support and the fact i was running a marathon i just didnt  mile 10 was a bit of a struggle but only mentally for some reason  i think i managed to convince myself that 10 miles was halfway there and then had to accept it wasnt  

x200b

 miles 10 to 18

between mile 11 and 13 you did a loop round and then came back on yourself  you also ran up over the overpass  ive run plenty of hilly races and this overpass felt like bloody everest  the crowd support was unreal through these towns though and it was awesome seeing so many people coming back  it made me realise soon enough that would be me and soon enough it was  i also saw two guys in giant bert and ernie costumes and thought mad i have to catch them up  

x200b

somewhere between these miles i also saw an enormous tortoise going up and down the pavement alongside us runners  it felt like he was taunting me but also he was super cool and it made me happy to see  i was having an absolute blast at this point the miles were ticking by and i felt carried along by the support and the other runners  i caught up to the 430 pacer and also overtook bert  ernie a man dressed in a huge rhino outfit and batman  

x200b

 mile 19

alpacas  in a field next to us  i love alpacas and got super excited but no one else did so i just bounced along in silent glee

x200b

 miles 20 to 23

at mile 20 i stopped for a loo break because while the queue would make me lose at least 5 minutes id rather be slower and retain some dignity  im no paula radcliffe  at this point i became aware that my quads were incredibly sore but it was only 10k to go so i cracked on  

x200b

the next two miles lumbered by and i became increasingly aware that i also had blisters forming on my toes and my thighs were chafing  the loose skin on them sometimes just seems to catch all wrong some runs and this was one of those runs  at mile 22 there were some st johns paramedics handing out globs of vaseline and i gratefully took one and tried to relieve some of the soreness  then wiped my eyes and spent the next 600m trying to stop looking like the twat whod just smeared vaseline all over their face and couldnt see  some lady thought i was crying and started shouting loads of encouragement which made me tear up for real 

x200b

 miles 23 to 26

yeah these ones hurt  my quads seized up and i started to walk 10m later i realised walking also hurt so i might as well run and all it was was one park run  id run park run when i had a bmi of 37 and id be damned if one defeated me now  so i ran a bit harder looking a little like john wayne after a particularly hard day in the saddle  

x200b

at about mile 25 you turn down the home straight and you can see the finish line  and a mile later it feels like youve been running for 3 years and the finish line is further away than before  i also need glasses but refuse to run in them as they annoy me and i cant wear contacts so i just go for the blind approach  this screws with my depth perception which also didnt help 

x200b

 mile 262 

one of my closest friends who has known me since well before this whole journey began and who has been one of the pillars in my recovery was at mile 26 with his partner  they started screaming my name and cheering and i managed to force my stubby little legs into a sprint scuttle but were being generous here  and then i was through the finish in 4 hours and 30 minutes  

x200b

 the aftermath and whats next

i very calmly walked round collected my medal and my tshirt and then met my friends by the exit  they said well done and i just started sobbing  i struggle with being proud of myself and i almost never am but right now i am  i made my body do things that 4 years ago i could never have contemplated and i loved it  i am frequently very mean to myself about how i look  i have loose skin all over and i still feel very chubby  but this has given me new power to keep the mean little voices at bay 

x200b

i drove home that evening 3 hours and spent today walking round london with two friends  my legs hate me my quads have fully disassociated from my body and i have weird chafe marks all over sorry underboob sorry lower back  but i am ebullient and all the sore bits are worth it

x200b

next i have a summer of shorter races up to half marathon and a 15 mile trail run  and a 24 hour team race with my running club  but im drawn to trying another marathon too  im going to keep long run sunday going and try and reach my goal of 1000 miles in 2019  and just keep loving running

out globs of vaseline and i gratefully took one and tried to relieve some of the soreness  then wiped my eyes and spent the next 600m trying to stop looking like the twat whod just smeared vaseline all over their face and couldnt see  some lady thought i was crying and started shouting loads of encouragement which made me tear up for real x200b miles 23 to 26yeah these ones hurt  my quads seized up and i started to walk 10m later i realised walking also hurt so i might as well run and all it was was one park run  id run park run when i had a bmi of 37 and id be damned if one defeated me now  so i ran a bit harder looking a little like john wayne after a particularly hard day in the saddle  x200bat about mile 25 you turn down the home straight and you can see the finish line  and a mile later it feels like youve been running for 3 years and the finish line is further away than before  i also need glasses but refuse to run in them as they annoy me and i cant wear contacts so i just go for the blind approach  this screws with my depth perception which also didnt help x200b mile 262 one of my closest friends who has known me since well before this whole journey began and who has been one of the pillars in my recovery was at mile 26 with his partner  they started screaming my name and cheering and i managed to force my stubby little legs into a sprint scuttle but were being generous here  and then i was through the finish in 4 hours and 30 minutes  x200b the aftermath and whats nexti very calmly walked round collected my medal and my tshirt and then met my friends by the exit  they said well done and i just started sobbing  i struggle with being proud of myself and i almost never am but right now i am  i made my body do things that 4 years ago i could never have contemplated and i loved it  i am frequently very mean to myself about how i look  i have loose skin all over and i still feel very chubby  but this has given me new power to keep the mean little voices at bay x200bi drove home that evening 3 hours and spent today walking round london with two friends  my legs hate me my quads have fully disassociated from my body and i have weird chafe marks all over sorry underboob sorry lower back  but i am ebullient and all the sore bits are worth itx200bnext i have a summer of shorter races up to half marathon and a 15 mile trail run  and a 24 hour team race with my running club  but im drawn to trying another marathon too  im going to keep long run sunday going and try and reach my goal of 1000 miles in 2019  and just keep loving

,,,,,,"every year nc state hosts a race this year february 2 where competitors and causal runners alike run roughly 25 miles eat one dozen krispy kreme glazed donuts and run another 25 miles back to be considered a competitor you have to do all of this in under an hour im 26 and ran my first marathon this past march so i believed that 5 miles plus a very large meal would be something i could do it was a very dumb thing to believe and the krispy kreme challenge brutalized my body and my soul massive eating was not part of my training for this race i thought i could get by on the fact that if i can run much farther than 5 miles i could take that extra effort and convert it into donut consumption very bad math sad

my friend alex and i drove up from charleston sc on friday after work this was his fourth time competing and would become his second time eating all twelve donuts and finishing in under one hour we arrived around 9 pm hung out with the people we were staying with for a bit one of whom also competed and went to bed alarm at 6 am starting line around 755 am lots of costumes and cold hands

the first 25 miles went smoothly i havent been training for speed at all the last few months but knowing i was going to be losing time in the middle to stuff down a dozen cold sugarglazed donuts had me huffing it harder than i wouldve otherwise about 825 a mile suffer the most at the beginning and the rest gets easier right wrong because i had no idea what suffering would follow

long rows of tables stacked with boxes of krispy kremes sat in the street i slowed to a walk grabbed a box moved past the tables and tried to find a place to stand to start cramming them down i brought some cheap gloves to keep the glaze off my hands and smashed three against each other making a donut burger the first three werent too bad the next two an openfaced donut sandwich were a little more rough while i ate i slowed down and spent more time watching the war zone in front of me i saw a guy puke while another walked in small circles nearby moaning i saw a guy sitting on the sidewalk legs splayed out in front of him chewing morbidly with a dead look in his eyes while an event photographer crouched in front of him camera in his face snapping picture after picture

i went back to a donut burger for 67 and 8 and really started to hit a wall the flavor of the sugar changed as my brain began to wake up to the horror i was committing against my stomach and the sweetness became nauseous and overpowering at this point each bite was being dipped into a cup of water to try and mitigate how dry and syrupy the donuts were making my throat but it was not enough by the end of those three i feel like donuts had revealed themselves to me in a new way like when nix shows scott bakula how he sees things in lord of illusions or roddy piper puts the glasses on in they live i felt sick they were disgusting and i hated them and i hated them even more because theyd beaten me trying to eat donut 9 my throat rejected each bite i tried to take there was nothing more to do id already taken a whopping 34 minutes it was a lost cause and i was a lost soul

the prospect of running 25 more miles to finish when i knew i had already failed the food portion of the challenge and when i knew i wouldnt finish in under an hour was bleak i started running past identical puddles of vomit as the course began to sloping uphill each burp was nervewracking coming up but liberating once it had passed i got faster and faster as the donuts settled in my stomach and was able to catch back up to a respectable pace the finish line showed up out of nowhere and i ran it in listening to cannibal ox the 10 minutes afterwards were rough as my body processed a couple different sensations that id call less than ideal

i havent decided if ill come back next year or not part of me wants to conquer the donuts even more now that ive failed against them and realized how intensely difficult they are for me part of me never wants to touch another goddamn donut its a little too soon to say but it felt rewarding to fail and to understand in a physical way how difficult the challenge is huge kudos to everyone who was able to eat the dozen and love to everyone who couldnt",1513,0.97,SpagettSpookedYa,Race Report: I failed the NC State Krispy Kreme challenge,,,every year nc state hosts a race this year february 2 where competitors and causal runners alike run roughly 25 miles eat one dozen krispy kreme glazed donuts and run another 25 miles back to be considered a competitor you have to do all of this in under an hour im 26 and ran my first marathon this past march so i believed that 5 miles plus a very large meal would be something i could do it was a very dumb thing to believe and the krispy kreme challenge brutalized my body and my soul massive eating was not part of my training for this race i thought i could get by on the fact that if i can run much farther than 5 miles i could take that extra effort and convert it into donut consumption very bad math sadmy friend alex and i drove up from charleston sc on friday after work this was his fourth time competing and would become his second time eating all twelve donuts and finishing in under one hour we arrived around 9 pm hung out with the people we were staying with for a bit one of whom also competed and went to bed alarm at 6 am starting line around 755 am lots of costumes and cold handsthe first 25 miles went smoothly i havent been training for speed at all the last few months but knowing i was going to be losing time in the middle to stuff down a dozen cold sugarglazed donuts had me huffing it harder than i wouldve otherwise about 825 a mile suffer the most at the beginning and the rest gets easier right wrong because i had no idea what suffering would followlong rows of tables stacked with boxes of krispy kremes sat in the street i slowed to a walk grabbed a box moved past the tables and tried to find a place to stand to start cramming them down i brought some cheap gloves to keep the glaze off my hands and smashed three against each other making a donut burger the first three werent too bad the next two an openfaced donut sandwich were a little more rough while i ate i slowed down and spent more time watching the war zone in front of me i saw a guy puke while another walked in small circles nearby moaning i saw a guy sitting on the sidewalk legs splayed out in front of him chewing morbidly with a dead look in his eyes while an event photographer crouched in front of him camera in his face snapping picture after picturei went back to a donut burger for 67 and 8 and really started to hit a wall the flavor of the sugar changed as my brain began to wake up to the horror i was committing against my stomach and the sweetness became nauseous and overpowering at this point each bite was being dipped into a cup of water to try and mitigate how dry and syrupy the donuts were making my throat but it was not enough by the end of those three i feel like donuts had revealed themselves to me in a new way like when nix shows scott bakula how he sees things in lord of illusions or roddy piper puts the glasses on in they live i felt sick they were disgusting and i hated them and i hated them even more because theyd beaten me trying to eat donut 9 my throat rejected each bite i tried to take there was nothing more to do id already taken a whopping 34 minutes it was a lost cause and i was a lost soulthe prospect of running 25 more miles to finish when i knew i had already failed the food portion of the challenge and when i knew i wouldnt finish in under an hour was bleak i started running past identical puddles of vomit as the course began to sloping uphill each burp was nervewracking coming up but liberating once it had passed i got faster and faster as the donuts settled in my stomach and was able to catch back up to a respectable pace the finish line showed up out of nowhere and i ran it in listening to cannibal ox the 10 minutes afterwards were rough as my body processed a couple different sensations that id call less than ideali havent decided if ill come back next year or not part of me wants to conquer the donuts even more now that ive failed against them and realized how intensely difficult they are for me part of me never wants to touch another goddamn donut its a little too soon to say but it felt rewarding to fail and to understand in a physical way how difficult the challenge is huge kudos to everyone who was able to eat the dozen and love to everyone who couldnt

 training
i used the nyrr virtual trainer program for this race i got the 16 week moderate plan i dealt with a hip injury in juneearly july so i wanted to be a bit more conserative that i would usually if i hadnt been injured i probably would have tried to go with pfitz 1855 instead i averaged about 42 mpw over those 16 weeks with one workout in the middle of the week track work or tempo and a long run on the weekend i did 2 20 milers one with a short 5 mile mp tempo in the middle most of my long runs were done 100 at easy pace but there were 2 or 3 with short workout sections in the middle overall im glad i didnt try to push too much in training my fitness still increased a lot and i would definitely feel comfortable doing my next training cycle at 5560 mpw which i think would lead to even more improvement

 prerace
woke up at 345 to get ready and catch the subway to the midtown bus bus ride was super quick thankfully and we managed to get through the security checkpoint before everyone and their mother arrived staten island is cold sitting around for two hours freezing in sweats was not super fun i definitely had a moment of regret i was glad that i was in wave 1 though also i think i set a new personal record for men peeing outdoors spotted while in the starting corral after some difficulty i managed to find ujeadeen who graciously offered to pace me to a 330 finish and we headed the start line 

 race
miles 110

the verrazano bridge is almost a mile long and almost 4 grade and its the first mile of the race i tried to stay conservative and not go out too fast i was on the lower bridge and i had heard rumors about runners getting peed on by runners on the upper bridge this is true i managed to avoid most of it but i did indeed get some specks of pee on my forehead i felt like i was getting the true nyc marathon experience i had done a little bit of course research and knew that i should be trying to split the first mile at around 840 pace i never saw a mile marker until mile 2 so my first two splits are estimated based on the gps data the rest of the race i took manual splits at every mile marker so i didnt have to worry about the buildings messing up the gps data and telling me i was running 15 minute miles 
mile 2 was pretty much all downhill leaving the bridge and i ended up going a little faster than i anticipated my plan was to run by feel for the first 20 miles then start making sure i could still run race pace to the finish
at around mile 3 my wave green merged with the blue and orange waves there was a moment when i looked up and just saw the massive crowd of people ahead of me filling the streets and i got really emotional and grateful that i made it to the start line
miles 410 were mostly a blur we were ticking off solid miles hovering around my goal pace of 800 minute miles i felt super comfortable and didnt feel like the pace was very hard at all which i knew was a good sign if i could stay relaxed and cruise until mile 20 i was hoping to be in a good place to avoid hitting the wall and finish strong 
i took honey stinger gels at mile 5  10 originally i had a flipbelt around my waist to hold my gels but at around mile 10 i was fed up with it and took it off and threw it away stuffing the rest of my gels into my sports bra 
we caught the 330 pace group somewhere in those miles and we figured they must be going a little slow or trying to negative split the race as they started about a minute ahead of us and we were still pretty much on track for a 330 finish
the aid stations began to get a bit more chaotic with people darting in front of you to grab water and then immediately coming to a full stop to drink i had to really practice my dodging skills as well as making sure not to slip on all the discarded cups

miles 1120
somewhere around mile 10 or 11 we went through the hasidic jewish neighborhood this is a really unique part of the course as its almost completely silent and bare of spectators i actually really enjoyed this part as it gave me some time to take a mental break from the craziness of the rest of the course it was also fairly emotional after the recent shooting at the synangogue in pittsburgh
we hit the pulaski bridge at around mile 13 its not a long hill only around 025 miles long but the 4 incline is definitely noticeable we split the half marathon point at around 144 right on track i still felt pretty relaxed and even the hills werent spiking my heart rate too much im not good at hills yet working on it
a couple miles later we hit the hard bridge the queensboro bridge its at mile 15 075 miles long 3 incline and completely devoid of spectators oh man it was rough we passed a lot of people walking on this one i knew that once we made it over wed hit the insane crowds at mile 16 so i used that thought to propel myself forward
mile 16 was also where uoctopifungus was waiting to cheer us on that was a huge mental boost and it perked my spirits up after the killer bridge at around mile 18 i started to have really bad stomach pain i have a fairly sensitive stomach ibs gluten issues lactose intolerance you name it and i knew it wasnt going to go away until i found a porta potty i made a pit stop during mile 19 and it added around 40 seconds to our time i knew those 40 seconds could be make or break when it came to my time goal and i really hoped it wouldnt come back to bite me in the ass later
by mile 20 i wasnt feeling great anymore my right quad had started to hurt quite a bit and it definitely felt like a lot more work to maintain race pace i started to worry about hitting the wall and missing my goal i had taken a gel at mile 15 and took my last gel at mile 20

miles 21262
this is where the real race starts i guess mile 21 and 22 passed fairly uneventfully just grinding i kept telling myself i just had to make it to the next mile marker and thats all that matters no need to worry about the miles left after that until you get there 
mile 23 was absolutely one of the toughest parts of the entire race its almost completely uphill at around 2 grade doesnt sound like much but after 22 miles its terrible i still have no idea how i survived it i refused to look up the street to the end of the hill so far away just kept looking in front of me and concentrating on keeping pace we were a little over pace on this mile and i could tell it was going to be really close if we were going to make it in under 330
i started to prepare myself mentally for the chance of not meeting my goal i knew id still pr and i knew i had greatly improved my fitness over the past 16 weeks of training i knew id be disappointed in myself if i gave up and i decided that even if i couldnt make my goal i was going to give it everything i had until the last possible moment 
central park was hard i kept telling myself i had less than 2 miles to go less than 15 miles to go etc i had tunnel vision for the last mile or so just concentrating on keeping up with ujeadeen i stopped looking at my watch and just tried to run hard but not hard enough that id be burnt out before i made it to the finish line once i saw the sign for 800m left i knew i had to push it i told myself that 800m was only two laps on the track and i can do that no problem
i checked my watch and i could tell that sub330 was still possible so i just ran with everything i had left we crossed the finish line i stopped my watch and burst into tears we made it in 32943 17 seconds under 330

 postrace
lots of crying lots of hugging we made our way through the finish area grabbing our medals heat sheet ponchos and plastic backpacks full of water and food i split off from ujeadeen after that as i had the postrace poncho option and he had done bag check i found my family and started crying again while hugging my mom and my boyfriend i watched my mom run the boston marathon in 2004 and ever since then i had a dream of running it myself while she watched telling her that i qualified was hugely emotional and meant so much to me
im hoping my 17 seconds is enough of a buffer to be able to register for 2020 but if not im fairly confident i could run another marathon and get a bigger buffer if i chose a flatter faster course and also did a more intense training plan im still undecided on if i want to run another marathon next year though im planning on getting back to doing more trail and ultra events for 2019 and 2020 so well see i defintely am tempted to see how i could do on a higher mileage training plan however

so i ran the chicago marathon back in october so i started this training cycle with a decent base already race reporthttpswwwredditcomrrunningcomments9nev8pchicagomarathonfirstbigrace6monthshttpswwwredditcomrrunningcomments9nev8pchicagomarathonfirstbigrace6months for this training cycle i really wanted to include more progression runs tempos and strength training my peak weekly mileage hit 67 miles i typically would take 1 day off a week saturdays and raced a bunch of times i did 4 long runs of 20 miles and would try and throw tempos in during them once of them i did 10 miles  630 pace i tried to incorporate more hills too since i knew the course was going to be hilly during this training cycle i actually managed to pr in both the 5k 1831 to 1812 and the half marathon 123 to 121 so leading up to the race i felt very confident that a pr was in my future my previous marathon pr was 25858 so my goal was to run under 255 everyday or every other day after my runs i would use the bosu ball for core weights for my arms and back and do squatsleg exercises i believe this is where i really noticed a big change in my training i am also 10 months postpartum and breastfeeding so i had to up my nutrition game as well i decided to run this race after my hs track coach emailed a bunch of us and asked if anyone would be interested in running it he moved from nj to austin 5 years ago and wanted to get a mini reunion together when i got that email i knew immediately that i wanted to run this race why well my little sister had moved to austin 2 years ago and i still hadnt visited her so this was the perfect reason to race and get in a vacation so i actually signed up for the race before chicago and was accepted into the elite field i was pumped and ready for my next big challenge

prerace

three weeks before the race my left knee started to bother me the pain was on the inside just on my kneecap it felt like i had a bruise on my knee when i bent my knee backwards it felt as if the muscle on my knee was a tight elastic band that was going to snap so i did everything in my power to help heal it before the race  so i riced epsom salt baths cbd oil heat stretch foam rolling massage  i did everything luckily the week of the race the pain had subsided and wasnt bothering me that much  two weeks out and 1 week out i got two sport massages to really get my muscles loosened those definitely helped get all the junk out of my legs my husband son and i arrived to austin on friday evening around 6pm we met my family out at matts el rancho for dinner the queso dip and margarita martinis are amazing i wasnt planning on drinking but i figured i had all day saturday to rehydrate so i enjoyed a margarita martini and actually got a little buzzed it was a big serving saturday i woke up and started pounding water like it was my job i drove over to the expo and got my race packet and bib then around 2pm i met my coach at a local park that overlooks austin to do a 4 mile shake out run we caught up and stretched that night my husband son and i went to op italian for dinner i got my normal prerace meal of broccoli rabe and sausage i was in bed by 930 luckily my son who is now 10 months old fell right to sleep and stayed asleep all night

race morning

my alarm was set for 445 am all throughout the night i kept waking up to check my alarm to make sure i hadnt slept through it when i got up i immediately pumped for 20 minutes to make sure my boobs were fully drained sorry tmi and ate some pretzels with pb and a granola bar i left my hotel around 545 and got myself a coffee in the lobby when i arrived to the race i found a spot right by the bag check area to sit and relax before i checked my stuff around 630 i checked my bag and went to the porta potty one last time and fought my way through the crowds to the start when i got to the start line i was ushered into the elite area and this is when the nerves really hit me i stayed calm though and put my ear plugs in my ears and waited for the gong to be rung i realized i like wearing ear plugs because i cant hear my feet hitting the ground and it almost helps me feel like im floating which helps me feel like im light on my feet

race

mile 16 i knew would be the easiest the initial 2 miles of uphill on south congress wasnt a big concern of mine i had trained on hills like this so i knew they wouldnt be an issue i felt smooth and relaxed around mile 65 my hs coach who was riding his bike saw me and rode next to me for about a half mile it was nice to see someone i knew as we turned onto cesar chavez street i saw my whole family my mom  dad sisters husband and son and my inlaws it was nice 

x200b

miles 713  honestly i knew i was running fast and felt in control so i just kept my eyes on the runners in front of me and tried to use the hmers as much as possible before they split off the hill at mile 12 can suck it i wasnt bad it just was annoying especially since as soon as we got over it i was running in no mans land after the half marathoners went to the right and the marathoners went to the left 

x200b

miles 1420  my hs coach found me again and rode next to me for maybe a mile this time he was talking to me and reminding me to relax my shoulders and really try and focus on catching the female in front of me she was about 150 meters ahead again though i was all alone and it was tough i mean in all the other marathons ive run ive had loads of people to race with running on the rolling hills alone was a little disheartening especially since the crowd support just wasnt there i had to remain focused and just get to the finish line 

x200b

mile 2126  this was it i knew my pace had fallen off a bit the female in front of me had increased her distance on me and i was passed by 1 guy i tried to stay with him but he made a nice surge and left me in the dust mile 25  when we got to the last hill i seriously wanted to cry my quads were screaming at me and i wanted to stop i knew though as soon as i got over that hill the finish line was right there so i pushed as hard as i could and ran to the finish and got a new 8 minute pr of 25013 

x200b

crazy thing about this race is that i dont really remember a lot of it i have one memory at mile 7 12 and the hill at the end but everything else is a blur im not sure if thats because i was running so hard and the lack of oxygen to my brain has affected my memory but seriously the race itself is a blur in my mind so i apologize if this was confusing and not interesting to read lol also im writing this on very little sleep our flight home was cancelled and my family and i didnt get back home until after midnight this morning and my son was up at 7 so im tired

anyway my coach found me after the race and told me i should set my sights on cim and trying to get the oqt b standard so i think thats going to be my next race goal ",246,0.97,BAM225,Austin Marathon

reporthttpswwwredditcomrrunningcomments9nev8pchicagomarathonfirstbigrace6monthshttpswwwredditcomrrunningcomments9nev8pchicagomarathonfirstbigrace6months for this training cycle i really wanted to include more progression runs tempos and strength training my peak weekly mileage hit 67 miles i typically would take 1 day off a week saturdays and raced a bunch of times i did 4 long runs of 20 miles and would try and throw tempos in during them once of them i did 10 miles  630 pace i tried to incorporate more hills too since i knew the course was going to be hilly during this training cycle i actually managed to pr in both the 5k 1831 to 1812 and the half marathon 123 to 121 so leading up to the race i felt very confident that a pr was in my future my previous marathon pr was 25858 so my goal was to run under 255 everyday or every other day after my runs i would use the bosu ball for core weights for my arms and back and do squatsleg exercises i believe this is where i really noticed a big change in my training i am also 10 months postpartum and breastfeeding so i had to up my nutrition game as well i decided to run this race after my hs track coach emailed a bunch of us and asked if anyone would be interested in running it he moved from nj to austin 5 years ago and wanted to get a mini reunion together when i got that email i knew immediately that i wanted to run this race why

background

i started running a little over a year ago and the gay 5k last april was my first ever race of any kind at that point i couldnt even run the whole 5k distance and was super proud of myself for runwalking the whole thing still am since then i have really gotten into running and have run several more 5ks finally completing one without walking in november around that time i decided that i wanted to work my way up to 10k becausewhy not im quite the slow runner but i love going longer and longer distances  its such a fun tangible way to see myself making progress as a very goalmotivated person i decided the best way to achieve this would be by signing myself up for the 2019 gay 10k that was back in november and since then i have been haltingly working on bumping up my mileage  from 31 to 4 to eventually 575 miles which as of last week was the longest distance i have ever run at one time

x200b

race

and then came today

i got up early this morning and headed out to the race site i actually kind of had two friends running with me my partner and our good friend had run the 5k with me last year and came back to do so again we all met up at the park where the race was held and loitered around for a bit before it was set to begin i tried to steal away into the portopotty one last time before we got started but i was still pretty far back in line when they called for the 10kers to line up so i gave up on that and went to grab a spot at the very back of the pack i was feeling pretty nervous which surprised me all week i had been amping myself up telling myself that it was just another long run that this is no big deal that ive got thisbut as i left my friends behind and joined the relatively small pack of impressive looking runners i was suddenly full of nerves

they did a few announcements and reminded us of the race route and as this all happened i tried to relax it was a cool overcast day in houston which was a blessing and i joked with the woman next to me that we didnt need to listen to the review of the course  wed be so far behind that wed just follow everyone else then suddenly it was time they did a full minute countdown and we were off

as i started off i could tell that i was going way too fast for it to be sustainable  i was swept up in the energy and the enthusiasm of the group i waved to my friends who were cheering me on from the sidelines and started to settle into a rhythm trying to slow myself down to a more sustainable pace after about two minutes i hit a good groove running close to a 15 min pace which is a little faster than i normally start out with for my long runs as i did so i realized that not only had i fallen to the back of the pack of 10kers  i was in fact the very last person in the group surprisingly this didnt bother me i found it more funny than anything else leading up to the race i had fretted and fretted about what if im the last person or what if i dont even finish before they shut down the race but here i was at the back of the pack and i was just happy to be out there i did make sure to snap a quick selfie of the empty path behind me to send to my friends who were still waiting to start their own race with the text me and all my friends

the first mile passed by easily and quickly  a little too quickly i thought and i tried to pull back a little bit more on my pace thus the tone was set for the rest of the race  i would catch myself pushing harder than i thought i should and ease off then not pay attention and find myself speeding up again in the end i probably could have pushed a little harder and finished a little faster but im glad that i took it easy this time as my main goal was just making it through the race

one thing i will say  all of my concerns about being the last runner and having the course shut down on me were unfounded i was incredibly encouraged for example that when i rounded the corner to finish my first lap and start my second the 10k was just the 5k loop twice there was a race official standing by the finish arch yelling if this is your first lap of the 10k go around for whatever reason i had assumed that they would have assumed that all the 10kers were through by then it was about 45 minutes in and i expected to be a bit confused about how to restart the loopbut they made it quite clear and i was easily able to get my second lap underway feeling both encouraged and determined as i knew that the first half was behind me

the second loop was relatively uneventful the course had thinned out considerably and i spent most of it running alone  which is honestly my preference  in the first loop the faster 5kers had caught up to be after about 15 minutes or so and i spent most of it running around other people by the second even the slower 5kers had cleared out and i was still bringing up the back of the pack for the 10kers so it really was just me my music and the beautiful wildflowerstudded bayou which was great

by the time i hit mile 6 i had actually passed two other people so i wasnt going to be dead last and i was ready to be done there was a street crossing facilitated by race officials and a police officer who cheered me on and after making it through that i started to sprint the last 2 miles as i rounded the corner to the finish most of the crowd had thinned out but my friends and girlfriend were there as was an official who gave my medal to my girlfriend to give to me as i crossed the finish line i finished my sprint over the timing mats got my medal and proceeded to chug a bottle of cold water as my friends congratulated me and regaled me with tales of their own races  they both set personal speed records which was super exciting

all in all it was an incredible experience  i am thrilled to have completed my first 10k with the same race that i did my first 5k i am also incredibly proud of how far i have come in just one year and i cant wait to see what future races have in store  if i wasnt hooked on running before i definitely am now

x200b

whats next

working on my speed up until now ive been focused on very slowly building up my distance because i find that more enjoyable still sometimes my long runs can feel a bit exhausting just from the sheer length of time that it takes me to complete them  because im so slow i expend a lot of effort keeping myself moving along the same distance as everyone else so im going to try and take some time to slowly and carefully work on improving my speed since im still so new at this i tend to be cautious because im afraid of getting hurt but i plan to do some exhaustive google research to map out a reasonable plan for working on that goal exact plan tbd but hopefully next time im here posting a race report i will have some exciting improvements to report

 training
im running a full marathon in may and wanted a race midway through training but there arent many halves in early march in new england for pretty good reason usually my time and energy are devoted to playing ultimate frisbee but i took some time off from indoorcold pickup to focus on running 

 prerace
oh boy where do i start the quick synopsis is the race lost their permits for an actual course so we had to use the 26ish mile loop they got for a 5miler and run it 5 times its snowed the last few weeks in new england and has been super cold  heavy wet snow was forecasted for 90 minutes after race start this race is the day of daylight savings so one fewer hour of sleep nothing was really set up when the majority of runners arrived including the bag check which went up around 20 minutes before the gun they did offer free parking however which was great because our public transit doesnt run early enough to work for a 7am start on a sunday in boston

 race
a few of the streets were still slightly mucky andor salty but if you didnt mind running past the same two dunkins for awhile it was actually pretty nice one person did slipfall near the start but no one i talked to after knew any details  its always a strange feeling seeing someone you dont know get hurt at a race as runners doing this thing together i may not know someone but feel like a community de facto anyway hope theyre okay 

i was really concerned about the nature of the race being loops but after the first one i found it really helpful to know exactly what to expect  i could set my pace a little more aggressive than normal for me at a half which ended up paying off because i felt confident in knowing what was literally ahead of me 

 postrace
there seemed to be a pretty significant after party with beer and a dj but i didnt want to stick it out in the snow and rain so i went home and watched the second matrix which is considerably better than i remember

edit  the jacket that came with this race is super cool and not like many of the other types of swag you get elsewhere and when i picked up my bib it seemed they had ample supply of all sizes not something you see all the time

 training
i had actually been quite consistent with my training through the cold winter months even using treadmills when it was too icy to run outside my general plan for each week was 50km total over five runs usually 10km 16km 10km parkrun 5km 10km i managed to keep this up for about two months leading up to this race i did annoyingly have to have a sixday hiatus when my tendons in my right knee started to feel really sore one night and i thought better than to chance it after the time out my first run back came with a very annoying but not painful ache in my lower left shin which always seems to come up after time away i pushed through this gently though because it always seems to vanish once i have a consistent string of runs going into the week of the race i still did my regular weekly schedule just with all the distances halved other than the parkrun which i took very steady

 prerace
it was one of those days you would hate if you were doing anything other than running quite cold and a constant drizzle but thankfully not too windy as such there werent really that many spectators throughout the race but there were still plenty to spur us all on

 kilometers 0 to 6
the race starts by taking you through the city and leading you out to the countryside there are a surprising amount of people out cheering on all the runners as it was absolutely miserable as this was my first half i was very conscious of being disciplined with my pacing at the start i was actually aiming to hover around the pace required for a 14500 458km just to get into the swing of things but as you can see from my splits this didnt happen i really felt like i wasnt going fast at all but the adrenaline and all the other runners flying off really skew your perception of steady i realised after the second kilometre that my pacing was already out the window so i decided to just maintain a faster pace and see how i faired very annoyingly four kilometres in my left shin started to feel a little sensitive its not enough to make me slow down but it is very offputting i pushed through and it thankfully went away after six kilometres

 kilometers 7 to 12
at the seventh kilometre you come out of the city and into the undulating countryside for every short uphill section a long downhill stretch shortly follows this is probably why its such a popular event the only downside is that there are now hardly any spectators about but at least there were still lots of runners around to drag me i dont normally drink any water when i run but i did use the water station at the seven kilometre mark as i definitely didnt drink enough before the race in my irrational stubbornness i refuse to slow down to potentially save those precious seconds and try to drink going at full speed over half the water misses and goes all over my shirt but at this point i was already soaked anyway so it hardly made any difference i hit eight kilometres and actually feel a bit heavylegged and this feeling carries on until twelve kilometres ive held this pace before fairly comfortably at this distance so this was quite frustrating i was really concerned about whether or not  i could hold on for the rest of the race at this level

 kilometers 13 to 14
absolute euphoria every single endorphin my body had to offer came at once i reach the top of a fairly steep climb and my legs have literally never felt better it was like the race had just started i had a pretty quick kilometre here without even trying also aided by the brilliant family sat outside their house playing really loud music shouting at you to keep pushing

 kilometers 14 to 16
where have the endorphins gone these are two of my hardest kilometres in the entire race every step has to have a serious amount of effort put into it and a fair few people coast past me while i try to push on it took an insane amount of willpower to not stop and walk for a minute at this point the only thing driving me on was the knowledge that if i kept going there was a really good chance of going sub 14000 the only thing keeping my splits relatively fast is the fact that this stretch is mostly downhill i was genuinely fighting hard to keep moving my legs

 kilometers 17 to 19
the willpower has really paid off at this point despite the fact that this was now unchartered territory for me longest training run was 16km i felt very good not completely fresh per se but my legs werent heavy anymore and my strides were fairly effortless we start to head through some suburbs where there are lots of families out watching the race and i run past the last water station again getting most of it over me i had watched a few halfmarathon vlogs the night before and remembered when one person said five kilometres left thats just an easy parkrun and it really helped push me on

 kilometers 20 to 211
all of the pushing has caught up to me now my legs have literally never felt heavier in my entire life but i know ive done enough to get my main goal provided i just keep moving i then realise that i could actually go sub 13900 if i have an insane final two kilometres so i just go for it i was helped a lot by a runner that overtook me just as i went to go all out who i tailed most of the way to the finish but eventually beat by about twenty seconds i get 200m from the finish and sprint with everything i have left spurred on by the sight of a very slow moving runner some fifty metres ahead i dont pass them but im right over their back heading across the finish line

 postrace
oh my god the pain everything hurts first my left knee then my tendons in my right knee then my toes and for the first time ever i have very sore nipples after a run really thought i would always be immune to that one we hobble to the muchdeserved pub

 whats next
i was planning on going hell for leather at the coventry halfmarathon later this month but with how sore i am i realise three weeks probably isnt going to be enough time to recover instead im going to pace a friend im going with to get them hopefully a sub 20000 run the next serious race for me will be a 10km run which im going to start incorporating interval sessions into my training for ive always known these will help my running ive just never got around to actually giving them a shot

thanks for reading this is my first racereport so sorry if its not that good

 training
a friend of mine encouraged me to sign up for a local 5k before the race i looked at the winning time for the 20162018 races and the best time in any of those was 2 minutes slower than my pr ive always wanted to be able to win a race so even though im not in my best 5k shape i thought this might be my opportunity my strategy was going to be to run a conservative pace so as not to burn out and have enough for a good spring finish if i was in the lead or to stick with the leader if someone went out faster than me  

 prerace
ive never raced to win before so when i arrived i nervously scoped out the competition at first i didnt see anyone who looked too competitive but then i saw a guy who looked like a perfect runner mr competitive looked like he could run with the best but i was still hoping maybe it didnt go past the looks

when we lined up at the start a youth group encouraged all their kids to go right up to the front annoyed i pushed my way past the kids and realize i was the only one older than 14 starting at the front maybe i had a chance but of course that thought barely entered my mind before i see mr competitive also pushing his way to the front

 race

the race starts and mr competitive goes out fast like really fast he went out fast enough that i was thinking it was probably just a strategy to get ahead of the pack before slowing down to his race pace well that wasnt going to work on me i was going to stick right behind him a tenth of a mile in hes not slowing down a quarter mile in hes not slowing down a third of a mile in hes not slowing down at this point i look at my watch and we are doing a 520 pace and just like that i was racing for second place as i slowed down and watched him pull ahead i tried to readjust my focus on just running the best race i could  through the first mile i looked back a few times and saw that the third place was far enough back i didnt need to be worried the race was an out and back so i saw mr competitive again at the turnaround and estimated he was about 1 minute ahead of me i did very well the rest of the race and was never close to getting passed by the 3rd place person

 postrace
i finished 2nd 1928 after mr competitive by more than 2 minutes 1715 but still ahead of 3rd place by another minute or so i got first in my age division and won a 25 gift card mr competitive was in the 40 age group i spoke with mr competitive and learned that he had won this race every year from 20122015 but just hadnt run it since then he also said this years performance was very bad for him i checked the results from the years he mentioned and he is usually under 16 minutes  maybe someday i will win a race but at least i won my age division

 note my splits are a little off my garmin tells me i did 133 mi in the same time frame and i noticed on the course i was hitting mile markers a little after my watch did


 training
a little over a year ago my wife got into running and encouraged me to start doing spartan obstacle course races i fell in love with them instantly and started running to improve my time between obstacles they are still my main focus but ive thrown a few road races in to help push me when we found out some friends had signed up for this local half marathon we thought it would be fun to join them based on my recent run speeds i set a rough goal of completing the race in 2 hours based on a 10k tuneup race a few weeks earlier most online calculators showed me at about a 152 half time


 prerace
a week or so before the race we discovered the start time was 630am a good deal earlier than our usual race start times we did an early pasta dinner the night before got up before the crack of dawn but otherwise had a somewhat normal morning got down to the race with pleanty of time to take care of business and get ready for the race


 race
for this event racers are lined up in corrals or pig pins based on expected finish times they were crowded and being crammed in with a large group of people always makes me anxious i lined up with the 2 hour pacer and tried to calm my nerves we were released in waves and just like the corrals the field was crowded for the beginning of the race i found myself growing angry with the walkers i had to navigate around less than 3 miles into the race how can you line up for a sub 2 hour finish and be walking less than 25 into the race seriously


right from the start i felt myself pushing to keep up with the pacer a 2 hour finish would be about a 909910 minmi pace average every time i checked my garmin we were doing about 830 minmi i couldnt figure out why we were so far ahead of pace until about mile 4 when we started the ascent the next 34 miles where uphill about 315 feet of elevation gain at this point i really struggled to keep up with the pacer without burning myself out i fell about 02 miles behind at one point where i almost couldnt see him any more i even took a wrong turn into a relay corral at one point and had to cut behind an announcer back onto the normal course which may account for some of the extra distance my gps recorded after that i pushed harder to catch back up to the pace group before we reached the top of the course


from here it was all down hill right the descent was just as steep as the ascent and i used every bit of that hill to push past the 2 hour pacer and start realing in racers ahead of me the rest of the course wasnt all downhill though it didnt go back up but i did have to push hard to maintain speed on the last 12 miles of flat course at the end since my gps was a little off from the course markers it was hard to judge wherewhen to begin my final push to the finish line i decided to start pushing when my gps showed a half mile left intending to accelerate to a sprint finish im happy with my effort at the end but i wouldnt call it a sprint


 postrace
all together im happy with my results the race was tough and the hills were no joke i accomplished my main goal and feel like i gave it everything i had some part of me wonders how i would have finished if i didnt have to weave through walkers early on in the race but thats part of the challenge at any race maybe next year ill work my way up to the full marathon

anxious i lined up with the 2 hour pacer and tried to calm my nerves we were released in waves and just like the corrals the field was crowded for the beginning of the race i found myself growing angry with the walkers i had to navigate around less than 3 miles into the race how can you line up for a sub 2 hour finish and be walking less than 25 into the race seriouslyright from the start i felt myself pushing to keep up with the pacer a 2 hour finish would be about a 909910 minmi pace average every time i checked my garmin we were doing about 830 minmi i couldnt figure out why we were so far ahead of pace until about mile 4 when we started the ascent the next 34 miles where uphill about 315 feet of elevation gain at this point i really struggled to keep up with the pacer without burning myself out i fell about 02 miles behind at one point where i almost couldnt see him any more i even took a wrong turn into a relay corral at one point and had to cut behind an announcer back onto the normal course which may account for some of the extra distance my gps recorded after that i pushed harder to catch back up to the pace group before we reached the top of the coursefrom here it was all down hill right the descent was just as steep as the ascent and i used every bit of that hill to push past the 2 hour pacer and start realing in racers ahead of me the rest of the course wasnt all downhill though it didnt go back up but i did have to push hard to maintain speed on the last 12 miles of flat course at the end since my gps was a little off from the course markers it was hard to judge wherewhen to begin my final push to the finish line i decided to start pushing when my gps showed a half mile left intending to accelerate to a sprint finish im happy with my effort at the end but i wouldnt call it a sprint postraceall together im happy with my results the race was tough and the hills were no joke i accomplished my main goal and feel like i gave it everything i had some part of me wonders how i would have finished if i didnt have to weave through walkers early on in the race but thats part of the challenge at any race maybe next year ill work my way up to the full marathonthis post was generated using the new racereportrhttpscoachviewgithubioracereportrhttpscoachviewgithubioracereportr powered by coachviewhttpswwwcoachviewiohttpswwwcoachviewio for making

 training
having followed hal higdon’s novice 1 training for my first marathon at bournemouth i decided i’d like to try something with a few more miles each week a friend had used and recommended the pfitzinger 1855 so i decided to give this a go

i’d experienced some hip pain in december and took a week off before starting the training this seemed to help but i consciously and at times probably subconsciously too kept my pace measured as i didn’t want the hip pain to come back again fortunately it didn’t

lots of very early starts for this one so that i could fit everything into the day earliest was 0450 invested in a headlamp and can’t recommend these highly enough actually getting out of bed wasn’t always easy but i love getting out for a run at that time and enjoying the peace and solitude

i finished my first marathon in 349 and i thought i could reduce this time particularly if following a tougher training plan i decided to aim for 8 minute miles possibly a bit ambitious but at least if i got close i knew i would set a pb in this marathon

i had a virus of some sort in late january so had to take a week off the plan for this but other than this didn’t miss a single day’s training i did find as i got further into the schedule my speed was increasing a lot on each run i was pleased in a sense but didn’t want to go too fast and cause an injury…

sure enough around four weeks before the marathon i became aware of a pain at the topback of my right leg i was aware of it with each running step i took although i didn’t think it really hindered my running too much most of the time got a sports massage which didn’t seem to touch it and rolledstretched which also didn’t seem to do much good while concerning i decided to basically hope for the best and for nothing to snap during the race itself  

 race strategy
i decided i’d use gels only this time at bournemouth i had some clif bloks which were good but a bit unpleasant to eat realised i had some caffeine gels in amongst my stash so decided i’d take 6 gels in total alternating between noncaffeine and caffeine

i should probably have studied the course a bit during my training rather than asking my mate the night before but oh well he told me about a somewhat nasty hill around mile 10 i’d sort of assumed throughout my training that the course was largely flat and hadn’t done much hillwork during training still i was confident that my training miles should see me through i’d walked a couple of hills at bournemouth and ideally didn’t want to do this again but would just have to wait to see how i felt
  

 prerace
stayed at my friend’s house the night before and he’d fed me with a large helping of pasta i woke up feeling some nerves but some excitement too had a couple of slices of toast and some coffee went to the toilet more times than i cared to mention and before i knew it the time had come for my friend to drive me to the start point checked i had my gels phone earbuds and off we set

i stood in the 300 to 330 finish area prerace lots and lots of people there had a brief panic that maybe i’d entered the half rather than full but pulled myself together countdown was over and we were off

 miles 1 to 6
i found the first few miles tough going the half and full marathon runners all run the first loop of the course together and as a result it was really congested a few people were darting in and out to get ahead of people but i thought this was likely to use up a fair bit of energy and knowing my luck i’d end up tripping over someone temperature was a bit warmer than i was used to as well in part because i was running later in the day than i usually went out

miles were well over the 8 minutes i’d aimed for i wasn’t hugely concerned but knew i’d need to at least sustain my pace if i wanted to beat my previous marathon time

noone told me the itchen bridge was a horrible uphill thing felt surprisingly tired as i went over this the first time but reminded myself i’d put in the miles in training had run 20 miles three times and that this would pay off at least i hoped it would and that my leg injury wouldn’t suddenly snap

took a gel shortly after each water station these definitely helped

 miles 7 to 131
my pace was still a bit up and down but i’d at least settled into a rhythm i knew the average 8 minutes per mile goal was beyond me now but i wasn’t too concerned i was confident having done some approximate maths in my head that i could still set a pb so pressed on

as a southampton fc fan running through the stadium gave me a rea lift i’d been looking forward to this and it didn’t disappoint

lots of really vocal supporters shouting encouragement which helps keep the spirits up and it no longer felt so hot all good

reached ‘the hill’ that my friend had warned me about it was unpleasant but i kept going was pleased to reach the top before realising that in fact i hadn’t was pleased when i actually did reach the top the reward was some running through a nice green area and what felt like some downhill bits all a bit of a blur

and my leg injury still hadn’t snapped  

 miles 131 to 19
always nice to get past the halfway point the half marathon runners had finished and the roads felt much less congested as a result my earlier tiredness had gone and i felt pretty comfortable 

spotted a toilet and decided i’d pop in 30 seconds max so it didn’t add on too much time

i came to a station handing out lucozade wasn’t sure whether to have any or not i’d not trained with any and was already taking in a lot of sugar from the gels what if it messed my stomach up what if i was sick down my front what if it made me badly need the toilet before i could reach one all common sense told me not to take one

took a bottle anyway and had it didn’t drink it all but it definitely gave me a boost

had to run over itchen bridge again but at least knew what to expect this time and it’s at least not as bad as you come back over it

i was aching a bit and the injury was reminding me of its presence but thankfully not snapping suddenly wondered if i’d taken a wrong turn somewhere because i was sure i should have run through southampton’s stadium again by now but decided my brain was probably just playing tricks on me

again loads of support always amazes me that people are so kind and encourage total strangers one girl sprayed me with a hose which was incredibly refreshing and shouted “we believe in you” which was lovely  

 miles 19 to 262
felt tired as you’d expect but not shattered the not very carefully thought out gel routine seemed to be working i’d found these miles pretty savage at bournemouth and had felt quite sick so it was good to still feel strong

again going through the southampton stadium gave me a boost this time i was the only one there expect for a race steward which was a bit surreal but also cool
i approached ‘the hill’ again i wasn’t really relishing the challenge but felt pretty strong and was confident i wouldn’t need to walk kept going listened to some inspirational music and compared the miles remaining to the shorter runs i’d done during training 

reached the top of the hill and knew it should be relatively plain sailing from here i saw others with cramp or having to walk but unlike at bournemouth i felt i still had energy left to burn actually overtook a fair few people and knew the finishing line wasn’t far off

called my family via a whatsapp video call and turned my phone forward so that they could see the finishing line there it was picked up the pace for the final couple of hundred metres and it was all over i was tired but not exhausted didn’t feel sick had experienced no toilet mishaps and my leg injury hadn’t exploded 

 postrace
got my medal picked up my other bits and pieces and had a halfpint of fosters i’d never really understood the appeal of beer after a race before but this went down very nicely met up with my friend who drove us back to his

took off my socks and one foot looked like something from one of the hostel movies looked worse than it was though had a shower and began to feel like a human again had some steak and chips which after burning over 3000 calories went down very nicely

checked my time got 0339xx i’d missed the 8 minute mile target but beaten my previous time by over ten minutes so was really pleased average mile was 817 not bad

 whats next
i’ve got the plymouth half in two weekends planning to take it easy this week before some light training again next week

i’d like to do another marathon later this year if possible and have applied for london the odds of getting a place are slim but you never know

 training
i’m not some kind of speedy gonzales but i’m all about improving myself as much as i can i ran the rotterdam marathon before this was supposed to be my fourth time first time in 443h my first marathon whatsoever second time in 500h the heat got me and last year 422h a big step up for me anyway i started training six months ago because i wanted to do it properly this time and maybe go for that sub 4 it was ambitious but it was achieveable during my trainings my long runs were in a tempo of 535 per kilometre and i didn’t feel like i was pushing myself i was fine it was good

in february i got sick i never get sick i tried to run while i was sick but no not a good idea after a week and half of no training i had a two week trip to peru planned while the heights could have been beneficial my stay was too short and i still was sick and than i got sick again but it wasn’t a cold my simple apparently super sterilized bowels did not agree with peruvian food cleaned with water in a week i lost two kilos i’m 160cm just by pooping out anything i ate or drank that was quite an experience in general did not know one could poop even if there’s just water in you 
in march i was back and started training again my tempo was slowed down and sub 4 seemed out of the question i trained like hell and sub 4 came close again but i didn’t get my hopes up finish a little under 420 was fine with me

 prerace
nothing special the early evening i went to a small music festival at a café nearby i was mostly looking at the people not the bands low budget festivals here seem to bring out interesting people very bronze man who in close up was orange hobo with long hair and pointy beard woman with smudgy cleopatra make up very fascinating i always respect it when people look so funky and crazy to me but they don’t care anyway i was doing well just non alcoholic drinks for me and i went to bed on time the next day i at my breakfast couldn’t decide about what to wear because of the potential heat shirt no tank top no no no shirt okay no tank top and i went to he bathroom my period was lingering and ofcourse today was the day shit ofcourse today okay well i was prepared got great tips here on reddit

 race
15km
my first 5k went well an average pace of 5’38 min my plan was to run a little faster the first 4km and slow down for 1km my heart rate was a little high so the slow down was good i drank water at the first post which went well 

510km
still fine i didn’t realize i already was at 6km it felt like 3 

1015km
everything seemed fine i started to feel tired but i figured it was just the heat so i slowed down a little i took my phone opened up netflix and put the two towers phone on lock movie on play i should explain i prefer a movie i have seen 10 million times and i can just listen to over music or a podcast i just listen to the movie and run last year i did that with gladiator worked perfect for me

tragedy struck or better yet and probably the partially the cause of what happened next my period struck i drank some water again and all of a sudden from 10km to 12km i got breathing issues it started out when i drank the water so i thought that was the cause so i slowed down i felt like someone was trying to choke me i stopped and walked for a minute to catch my breath when i thought it was alright i started running again but much slower 610min then i intended usually i can talk with someone when i run that pace but now pretty much straight away the choking feeling started again

at 12km i came to a full stop panting swiveling shaking legs i got off the parcours and i felt like fainting i sat down and people are so sweet to help you offering you everything i sat with my head between my legs and  as sobbing mess  i started crying i realized it was over the inner battle began “it’s not over yes it is you can’t do this you can but not today but i want to i want to finish no you can’t not today you have to stop” 

i ran or jogged for a couple of metres until i saw i red cross post which was stupid because the light headedness got worse the breathing got heavier and more difficult i stopped and i still had breathing issues it felt like a panic attack but then just without the panic the man that helped me was great and funny looking btw i think he had three teeth in total he was good man doing his job well but the lack of teeth was kind of cheering me up and made me chuckle i explained to him and the one of the other red cross volunteers that i have an iron deficiency in general i do not very heavy but i do have it and my period started today they all said i wasn’t allowed to run anymore my physical condition wouldn’t let me   i sobbed again no rotterdam marathon this year when even they said “no” i realized it was truly over and that kind of broke my heart i trained for months for this and it was over after an hour and then some 


 postrace
my boyfriend picked me up and we traveled by subway home  he wanted a different stop than usual fine when we got out my mom and my sister surprised me they traveled for three hours which is long in the netherlands to see me run i cried again if you didn’t know by know running is something i can get emotional about because i love it and periods don’t tone that down we had a good lunch and some beers with them and some friends it was a good end to a crappy day my first beer in months tasted great 

i’m not one to be sad about this for too long it sucks sure my heart is a little broken sure but that’s okay it wasn’t my day today next year i’ll run it again one sucky marathon won’t stop me ever 

i apologize if the story was too long btw thanks if you made it to the end

 training

this was my third half and i continued with my tried and true training plan hal higdon intermediate one long run per week including one twelvemiler and either 400meter intervals or a tempo run mileage was usually around 30 miles per week my overall goal was to pr and not end up in the medical tent hypoglycemic at the finish of my last half and my ultimate goal was to finish sub150 

x200b

 prerace

surprisingly i slept pretty well the night before i really wasnt looking forward to the race because it was supposed to rain and im a wimp with the elements but it all turned out okay morning of i had my usual english muffin with peanut butter and some water met with my college team for some pictures then saw off the marathoners the half started at 8 am 

x200b

 strategy

my plan was for negative splits to hold back in the beginning and save that adrenaline energy for later for fuel i was planning on having gatorade prime chews at miles 6 and 9 but ended up forgetting them with my family when i went off to the start line trying to stay positive i told myself that the route was bound to have gatorade which i have had before on training runs so my stomach would be okay with it and that would have to do in reality the race only had nuun and gus but i really dont trust my stomach with gusso i had only water and nuun during the race ugh 

the first 89 miles felt fantastic it seemed to be a constant slight incline but i managed just fine after that i hit a major wall ive never hit a wall before during a race and i realized that the lack of fuel was hitting me by mile 11 my thoughts were kinda blurry if that makes sense at that point i dropped my dream of sub150 and decided i just wanted to finish

x200b

 postrace

i crossed the finish line in a panic my vision was blurry and i felt like i was going to throw up or pass out or both my boyfriend tossed me some of the prime chews and about a half hour and 200calories of sugar later i was back to normal i kept walking to clear my head major shivers from the rain that went away as soon as i hopped in the shower i was super stoked about my pr especially given my situation and the fact that i was able to manage my hypoglycemiainduced anxiety without having a fullblown panic attack was a huge win once i got home i had a second breakfast of scrambled eggs and an english muffin then a hourlong nap with burning legs i had super cravings for my aunts cheesy broccoli and chicken casserole and luckily i was able to get the recipe and have that for dinner my legs were the most sore they had ever been the following two days im almost recovered at this point four days out 

x200b

 whats next

i want to keep the current endurance i have going right now for the rest of the summer so im planning on a few more 10milers and halves for the next few months i will be running the boston marathon my first ever full marathon next year with my school and im hoping that i can learn the best fueling strategy for my body by then my other goals include incorporating more strength training currently only once a week adding in some biking more stretching and better nutrition this run was brought to you by my college diet of pbjs and chicken stir fry

 training
i picked up running again in september 2018 after a long break years with the goal of running a marathon i looked at philadelphia in november but after the much needed convincing from my wife i signed up for the half marathon rather than the full so glad i did because the full would have killed me after finishing my full i realized i had no clue the training required for a full marathon so i ran the philly half and was hooked on running again and soon after i signed up for the new jersey marathon set for april 28 2019 giving me more than enough time at least i thought it was enough time to train for a full marathon 

i chose the first marathon training plan 18 weeks due to my schedule 3 days of running per week speed intervals tempo long run and 3 days of hard crosstraining i ended up doing more than 3 running days pretty much every week substituting a run for the cross i started around 20 mpw had some minor injuries early which dropped me to 15 and 14 miles in consecutive weeks and had to build back up i averaged around 2830mpw for most of it and peaked at 34 during my 20 mile long run week all total i hit 448 miles for the training block this all sounded great to me because i had never run anywhere close to this many miles consistently but i was a little anxious going in after reading people running 50mpw for their first marathons i started to question my training rightfully so i would learn and got really nervous about the race but i chose my goals fairly conservatively i really just wanted to finish and felt sub4 was in reach my stretch goal was 330 but i knew i wouldnt be disappointed if i missed it the 330 goal was mainly based off the nyc half i ran in march 13732 then used the double my half 10 min formula that gets thrown around here 

 prerace
i woke up around 530 for the 730 start slept horribly the hotel we stayed at messed up the reservation and gave us a queen bed instead of the king we booked i know i know wah wah you big baby my wife and i are not small and it got cozy in the smaller bed but i didnt expect to sleep well so it wasnt a surprise breakfast was oatmeal and coffee same ive used for other races weather was really good the morning of i got to the start around 7 i think it was 52f11c at the start little to no wind which would change later and overcast i got to my corral and decided maybe stupidly to stick with the 330 pace group the wave went off at 3 minute intervals so we had a little wait in corral 3 so happy to hear the start horn they also had a bugler that played the traditional horse race start since we started at a horse track 

 race
started out great got passed left and right at the beginning but tried to stick to my plan went out right at 800 minute miles just ahead of the 330 pace group i was happy i didnt get caught up in the excitement and go out too fast settled in and fell back into the 330 pace group around mile 1 

first half was awesome felt good at 800minmile wind wasnt too bad at this point but knew once we hit the boardwalk wed be exposed to the coastal winds pace group was around 2030 strong saw my wife at mile 9 which was a great boost hit the halfway point at 14517 because i started a bit ahead of the 330 pace group my plan was to go hard from mile 25 to beat 330 sothat didnt happen

around mile 20 the real halfway point i started having problems 20 miles was my longest run and my body didnt like the extra running i was still with the 330 group of around 10 runners but knew i was holding on for dear life the wind at this point was rough i remember seeing gusts of 20mph predicted the day before and it felt like it right at us i did my best to draft off the guy in front of me sorry dude but it was still a lot of work to stay with the group by mile 22 i was cramping and saw my 330 goal running off in the distance literally i held on for as long as i could but was walking just before before the mile 23 marker i continued to move and after 30 seconds or so of walking i started to run again i was able to go about 34 mile running and then walk for a minute or so at this point i knew 330 was gone and started to look behind me every now and then for the 335 group which never came thankfully at this point i really regretted my lack of training mileage and felt severely undertrained but i was determined to finish the last 34 miles were absolute agony and my splits show how i was feeling my last 4 splits were 854 853 923 816 my legs were on a knife edge from full on seizing up but i finished 33354 and just in time for the rain

 postrace
first marathon completed now ill go lay down and die never felt anything like this holy moly marathons are tough honestly my first thought after finishing was never again but im thinking this thought is mostly because of my undertraining i cant complain though i finished and crushed my sub4 goal so overall i am ecstatic with my finish and as much as im hurting right now so sore i do want to train harder next time yes there will be a next time with that said i think i enjoy the half marathon distance more perhaps i was just undertrained and thus suffered more maybe i didnt push myself in the half to really feel this pain whatever the case i do want to give the marathon another shot i would love to go sub 330 and with a better training block i think i can

consistently but i was a little anxious going in after reading people running 50mpw for their first marathons i started to question my training rightfully so i would learn and got really nervous about

prerace trainingbackstory

i had originally wanted to do this race and set out last fall to start training  ran my first 10k in december and did a lot of treadmill runs because it was cold  i got the flu in january which completely knocked me out of training  and then a week after i was recovered from the flu i went to hawaii and got a sunburn so severe i could barely wear a loose fitting tank top let alone a sports bra to run  february was cold back home the weather sucked and i was insanely busy at work from taking a week off to go to hawaii  so basically i blew up my training midjanuary and all of february  march the weather got better and i started running a bit but nothing more than 3 miles  april came and i started running more  35 miles  5 days before the half marathon i ran 636 miles after work and felt great  decided i needed to try to run the half anyway even if it meant walking the last half  yep without proper training and never having run farther than 636 miles i was going to do a half marathon

x200b

morning of race day

i woke up at 245am unable to sleep because i was so excited  stayed in bed until 345 then got up and started getting ready  coffee and water to get the bowels moving  my big fear was not being able to have a bowel movement before the race but i think i was so nervous that wasnt an issue  i had a slice of toast with peanut butter and a banana at around 445  husband dropped me off right at my corral the very last one at 545 and i had to wait almost an hour for the start of the run  it was chilly in the low 50s with a bit of a breeze but we had clear skies  i had been told the last two years of the race it had rained so i felt lucky there was no rain at least  we had the prayer and 168 moments of silence for the 168 people who lost their lives in the okc bombing  the first corrals start to go and im nervous thinking omg i hope i dont have to go 2 again  just shy of 7am my group heads out

miles 13

this is the worst part of the race for me  i was cold and not warmed up  there were a crap ton of people  i was trying to get my pacing right  not too fast but not too slow  and my left ear bud wasnt playing music  great  131 miles ahead of me with only one working ear bud  i wasnt planning on wearing this pair of headphones either i left my nice dre beats at home on accident and just happened to have this pair in the car  but i guess one headphone is better than none i need music to run    there were some early hills that really lit my calves on fire and made it hard  i kept praying i didnt really need to use the bathroom  my right foot went numb asleep for about a mile  but once we got past mile 3 i started feeling better  

miles 48

im feeling great  this is why i love to run  this feeling  my body is just doing its thing my mental game is strong im loving the crowds and the beautiful views of the city  i took my first dixie cup of water around mile 5  i typically dont hydrate when ive run 6 miles but i felt i should start a little early to be safe  the view of the state capitol building was one of my favorite parts it was gorgeous  i took a bottle of water from an aid station so i didnt have to deal with dixie cup hell for a few miles  took sips of it as needed  around 10k my stomach started growling as if i was hungry  this is new  but i knew that gorilla hill around mile 85 would have bananas and that sounded good  the pretzels being offered did not sound good i was afraid they would blow up my mouth and make me choke so i avoided the pretzels  

miles 8510

gorilla hill was what i was looking forward to the most  i wanted bananas and its supposed to be the best aid station on the course  it did not disappoint  the crowds here were awesome  my husband and two of our friends surprised me out there with a sign and cheering and whistling  this was such a huge mental boost  i didnt stop kept going  i grabbed two bananas and a glazed donut hole omg this was such a treat  ate the donut hole first then started on the bananas  finished off the last of my water  after the half marathon and the full split in different directions around mile 9 the half marathon course was lined with the photos and names of the 168 victims  i started crying  seeing pictures of the little children and babies the adults young and old was just incredibly powerful  i also was really emotional from seeing my husband and friends and omg ive run 9 miles straight  you are a badass  i decided right then i was not walking any of this race  i pressed on and flew through mile 10 feeling empowered

miles 11131

around mile 11 my knees started to hurt and ache  its okay you can do this  youre not walking 2 miles out from the finish  i was also afraid that if i stopped i wouldnt be able to start running again so i pressed on  once the city came back into view i knew i was close  turned the corner into the city to see the finish and picked up the pace  crossed the finish line super excited grabbed my medal and went off to find my husband and our friends

post race

i have a blister on my toe and im stiff and a little sore but i feel great  we all went out for brunch after even though i didnt have much of an appetite  i just wanted all the water in the world and chapstick  omg my lips felt so nasty  no one had chapstick  ive already decided that chapstick or lip balm going with me on my next race  i will definitely do this race again next year  if i can properly train i want to do the full marathon  but i will at least do the half if im not ready for the full

x200b

the course was beautiful the crowds were fun  i swear the volunteers and everyone out there cheering really helps  bless them for spending their sunday morning cheering us on

walking 2 miles out from the finish  i was also afraid that if i stopped i wouldnt be able to start running again so i pressed on  once the city came back into view i knew i was close  turned the corner into the city to see the finish and picked up the pace  crossed the finish line super excited grabbed my medal and went off to find my husband and our friendspost racei have a blister on my toe and im stiff and a little sore but i feel great  we all went out for brunch after even though i didnt have much of an appetite  i just wanted all the water in the world and chapstick  omg my lips felt so nasty  no one had chapstick  ive already decided that chapstick or lip balm going with me on my next race  i will definitely do this race again next year  if i can properly train i want to do the full marathon  but i will at least do the half if im not ready for the fullx200bthe course was beautiful the crowds were fun  i swear the volunteers and everyone out there cheering really helps  bless them for spending their sunday morning cheering us on   x200bthank you for taking the time to read this and thanks for those of you who told me last week i should be fine to run the half  i am so glad i signed up at the last minute and did it even pulling in a decent time
happened on Saturday was a new one for me,,,,,,"i paced the milwaukee marathon on april 6 2019  you may remember the milwaukee marathon from its fiasco in 2016 where the course ran too long for the frontrunners  or the bigger fiasco in 2017 where the course was too shorthttpswwwjsonlinecomstorysports20171018errorleavespncmilwaukeemarathoncourseshort778021001 robbing some runners out of a boston qualification  

the race was purchased by rugged races who promised to do better this year and they did  the course was measured well with no complaints about length  the race featured a 5k half marathon and marathon starting and finishing at milwaukees new fiserv center downtown  the weather was perfect starting with temps in the 40s at the start and reaching the high 50s during the race  this race definitely needed a good year to turn around the previous few years and i think most runners would say that this year was it  

the course

i love the new course  in previous years the race really was a big tour of milwaukee which was great too  but it felt absolutely desolate in many areas especially for those of us at the back of the pack  there were sections of the 2017 race where my small group felt totally alone on the course  this year the race route still hit many gorgeous areas of the city  the lakefront beautiful old homes marquette universitys campus  but it included several outandbacks too so we always felt like we had lots of runners around  

pacing

2019 pace team photohttpsimgurcomlqmzgws

pacers are the runners who volunteer to run the race with an aim toward a stated finish time  pace teams typically carry a sign which states the goal time and runners whose goals match the pace can run with the pacer  by sticking with the pacer runners dont have to worry about time consistency etc  they can focus on themselves and if their pacer is doing his job theyll come in right on time   

different pace goals have different strategies for pacing  i always pace the 5 12 hour marathon finishers 1235mile so i cannot speak for the faster paces but for my group i walk through the aid stations power walk the hills but otherwise run a consistent pace  if i can i do try to bank about 90 seconds in the first half of the race to use at the end in the form of a few extra walk breaks when everyone is tired  i communicate that to my runners at the start and at every mile marker i announce where we are in relation to the target pace  i promise  it really isnt that hard to do  i enjoy it and pacing means a free race entry for me  since id rather pace than actually race this totally works for me  

ideally each pace group will have 23 pacers  there are lots of good reasons for that  things happen  sometimes a pacer can get injured so it is good to have a backup  sometimes a runner will need aid and pacers are asked to stay with down runners until help arrives  and it helps to have a few people to share the signonastick holding duties

i have not had the best luck in this regard   in previous races my copacer has dropped out on me midrace due to illnesses or injury  but at least they tried their best and hung on as long as they could  what happened on saturday was a new one for me

this time i had never met my copacer until the morning of the race  he seemed nice enough  and then when the race started he took off  within a half mile i saw him running up with the 515 pace group and by the time a mile had passed he was out of sight  he totally dropped me to go run his own race  which left me with 262 miles of holding the sign negotiating restroom breaks solo staying on pace and encouraging my runners all by myself  pardon my french but fuck him  that was a total crappy thing to do  not just to me but to the runners that rely on pacers

of course i stalked his finish time after the race  502  a friend in the 500 pace team said he ran with them for quite awhile  so i guess he just wanted a free race entry  whatever it was it was a dick move  

drama aside pacing went well  i had a wonderful group with mehttpsimgurcom0vwhrg4 for much of the race  by 20 miles in my group was doing good and we had about 90 seconds banked  i started to struggle around mile 22 i sure could have used a copacer to hold the sign for me but fortunately i found one of my old copacers from a previous racehttpsimgurcomg7kafmr  he lent a hand and stuck with me through to the finish line

obligatory dorky race photohttpsimgurcomakyg0qv  i have to say i have never had such free fast race photos in my life  they were basically ready when i hit the finish line  amazing

my watch read 52953httpsimgurcomr9j7ei8 when i crossed the finish line  the official finish time was something like 52942 but thats close enough too

 training
training went really well for me and i started training as soon as i knew i was accepted into the race  although i had been running regularly following my half marathon in september of last year  normally for training i would follow a training plan i found on line and run at whatever pace i felt like for that day  this year i decided to use the training app as part of your registration for the broad street run you were given access to the paid portion which was being able to email coaches of the app run coach so i decided to use it  at first i was because of the slow pace it was suggesting my training runs to be and the length of some of my training runs but i stuck with it and finished the training and felt good heading into the race until the weather took a turn

 prerace
with the weather calling for steady rain the entire race the last few days before the race were definitely a mental struggle for me  fighting between giving up on my pr goal because of the weather and telling myself that you put the training in you can still make your pr goal plus the added nerves of not knowing what to expect because this would be my first race in the rain on friday i posted the broad street run in the race roll call thread and between seeing others post about running the race as well and uagermanmuffin ensuring me that race conditions would still be favorable for a pr i got my confidence back headed into the race

 race
after waiting in the rain and getting the final nerves out of my system i ditched the poncho on the walk up to the start line put the music on and began my 3rd running of the broad street run  the beginning of the race is always congested because of the number of people running and this year was no different and possibly a little worse than years past  this actually helps me keep from going out too fast so i dont entirely mind it  although this year did seem worse because many slower runners moved up into higher corrals because of the rain and made getting around people a little more challenging after about a mile or so it thinned out and i was able to get into my zone and just run at my pace  i did the first 3 miles at an 817 pace without any problems and felt very comfortable  i knew i had a friend waiting at mile 6 to cheer me on so that kept me going and then gave me a boost as i passed by and heard them cheering  i managed to do the miles 47 in an 811 pace again feeling very comfortable and like i had plenty left to finish the race  keeping an eye on my time i knew it was going to be a challenge to make my ultimate goal of 12000 which in hindsight was probably unrealistic but i knew my goal of beating last years time was still achievable i finished the final 3 miles in an 811 pace despite feeling like i was slowing down i finished with a time of 12154 and made my goal of beating last years time and not only did i beat it but i smashed it by 3 and a half minutes  i didnt reach my goal of 12000 but seeing how close i came i know it is achievable  i cant wait until next year so i can go for another pr and that 12000 time

 postrace
post race was a bee line to get my dry clothes from the buses and then get to the subway as fast as possible so i could get dry and go meet up with my friend     
     
 whats next     
no races planned at the moment but will be training to run the rock and roll half marathon in philly again jut not sure if i will be in town to run it or not but i rather be prepared in case i am  ill probably try and get a couple of 5k or other runs in between now and then but not sure yet

 training  
the first week of january i decided to make the successful completion of the 2019 broad street run my primary nys resolution so i joined rrunning and started getting serious about mileage my boyfriend agreed to run with me and hes speedy like 21 minute 5k speedy but had never attempted any longer distances so it posed a challenge for both of us the first few months of the year were solely treadmill and yet somehow i still managed to fall in love with long slow runs set to new music once the weather started getting nice a couple months ago my form improved and i discovered strava ie once i got to the good part  i was hooked the month leading up to the race i averaged around 15 miles a week which was less than i would have liked but all i really had time for my boyfriend goes to school 400 miles away from me and despite some playful and persistent nagging on my part went on maybe 2 short runs in preparation for the race this only motivated me to train more because i was comfortable being beaten by an athletic and properlytrained dude but damned if id let my hard work be outpaced by mr two runs 

 prerace  
i go to school in boston but grew up near philly so the prerace process included a stinky 8hour bus ride i managed to forget my sneakers at school so i had to borrow my moms which i knew didnt bode well for the feetsies the weather was certainly gonna suck made worse by the fact that im a baby who never runs in the rain so i threw a fanny pack and a poncho into my bag and braced for the worst hoping for the best boyfriend had two finals the next day that he was woefully unprepared for so he elected not to run last minute which was a little disappointing but probably also for the best since i dont typically perform well with an audience 

i woke up late threw my gear on and ran to the subway station a half mile away from the boyfriends apartment boyfriend was out of coffee filters and i had no time to buy a cup beforehand for context im a coffee problemdrinker 48 oz a day or im toast so things really werent lining up well for me i had to throw myself between closing train doors into the human sardine can that was the train car despite protests from the other passengers lol as if that wasnt bad enough i noticed tons of people exiting the car about 3 stops before we were supposed to get off and quickly learned it was because the subway had broken down good old septa so my fellow passengers and i embarked on the nearly milelong jog to the starting line

 race  
it wasnt raining as bad as i thought it was going to but it was still enough that my headphones were too slippery to stay in my ears and i couldnt unlock my phone without a ton of difficulty so i didnt have music which would normally be a huge blow for me but luckily there were enough sights and sounds to distract me spectators with funny signs giving out high fives words of encouragement from other runners even the temple university marching band all made the day a lil more bearable i was in a corral that was probably a little slow for me so i had to do some bobbing and weaving but that was a good way to keep my mind occupied too all in all i felt fine and kept up a comfortable pace until probably mile 8 this was about the distance my training runs had maxed out and i just had to push through there was a wall of people right at the finish line to the point where it was almost impossible to cross and i wanted to hug all of them

 postrace  
took me like at least 45 minutes and a few very frustrating phone calls to locate my parents and get out of the cold rain and my disgusting clothes but i finally did and my parents and my boyfriend and i all went to this nice toasty warm dry pub where i ate my weight in wings and burgers

 whats next  
training for the philly half this fall looking to get on a proper training plan once school is over but for now just continuing to run for leisure and focusing on my lifts

 training
i followed pfitzingers 1855 plan started in late december all the way until the day of the marathon it mostly went well except for a few exceptions one week where i had a bad case of strep throat and missed a whole week of training suffering a possible herniated disc just a month before the big race and fighting off a stomach bug that caused me to miss my last long run before the marathon with all the missed miles i was worried about my performance but figured wed show up and do the best we can even so i logged nearly 700 miles in training and knew that id still be able to do decently

 prerace
i actually got a sports massage the afternoon before which helped a lot after that i drove straight down to champaign im from peoria so not a long drive and went to pick up my packet before i went to my hotel

i knew this would be a big event but it didnt dawn on me just how big this would be until i went to get my packet and thats when the nerves started kicking in i grabbed my packet went to the hotel to drop my stuff off then went to go get food i went to panera and got half a sandwich and half a salad added a banana and some plain bread too sat around in my room for a bit that evening realized i had too much energy and got up to go to the fitness center biked a very slow two miles then went back to my room and went to bed

 race
i accidentally woke up at 3 am the race started at 7 i ate breakfast just a banana and an rx bar then got back in bed for an hour or so before getting back up i made sure everything was ready then looked at the course map again i didnt really have a specific goal in mind i just knew i wanted to run faster than a 320 before i left i also had had a mix of bcaa beta alanine and half a scoop of preworkout i also took imodium pills which someone from here suggested and which worked a charm let me tell you

i got to the start with plenty of time to spare i got a good warmup in used the restroom one last time then went to my corral the nerves started up again but more in a oh shit its finally happening way rather than being nervous before we took off i reminded myself several times that we would take it easy the first few miles and ease into it

and thats exactly what i did didnt push myself just enjoyed the scenery and crowds around us truth be told there isnt much to talk about for that first part of the race other than the guy who puked somewhere between miles 3 and 4 me to myself this early come on dude having so many crowds around was pretty nice as well as the high fives from random people i also pet a dog with a sign that said pet me for a speed boost

i started keeping pace with another runner around the halfway mark and we talked for a bit while we ran he told me his goal was to hit 305 then asked me what my goal was i told him this was my first marathon and id be happy with anything faster than 320 to which he said youre doing really well then that was a nice boost as was my time as we crossed the halfway point

i told myself that as long as i kept the 305 guy in my sight id be alright and for a while i did i kept my mile times consistent and i knew this would be important for when i hit mile 20 when the wall would start rearing its head and boy did it  i saw guys around me and ahead of me start dropping like flies and walking i told myself we werent stopping werent walking no matter what  if i had to jog a 10 minute pace to the end i would have to give you an idea of how bad it was i ran the first 20 miles at a 710 pace the last 6 miles were at a 746 pace everything was tight everything hurt and a voice in my head kept asking me to just stop and rest but i couldnt do it i kept gritting my teeth and grinding through i also adopted kipchoges strategy of smiling through the pain my dad was around mile 21 or so to cheer for me which helped a bit but what really got me to the end was my brother finding me at mile 25 and running alongside me as motivation until he got yelled at to get off the course lmao

that last mile i really dug in i knew the end was just around the corner and a finish in the stadium my mother and sister were standing just before the finish cheering and taking pics i entered that stadium knowing id finish just over 310 i crossed that finish line with a smile 31005 97th overall of nearly 1100 people i got my medal a blanket then nearly fell over 

 postrace
after sitting down for a few minutes to soak everything in i went to go get a bit of food though truth be told i didnt have the stomach for most of what they had on offer pasta pizza etc i ate an rx bar i had brought along drank another bottle of bcaa chocolate milk and a bread roll i went back to the hotel showered checked out then drove home with my brother i had time to sneak in a small nap before i had to get dressed up and go to a wedding reception where i could barely walk ha

one slightly amusing thing i want to mention my family and one of my friends were tracking me through the app and apparently it glitched and said i stopped at mile 20 everyone thought id either gotten seriously injured or just gave up which is why my dad looked relieved to see me when i passed him a bit later

i plan on taking this week pretty easy no running just light biking and walking ill get back to running the week after as for my next marathon ive got my eye on a local one in october where ill be looking to improve on my time

splits mile  time  131  13234  131  13731  trainingi followed pfitzingers 1855 plan started in late december all the way until the day of the marathon it mostly went well except for a few exceptions one week where i had a bad case of strep throat and missed a whole week of training suffering a possible herniated disc just a month before the big race and fighting off a stomach bug that caused me to miss my last long run before the marathon with all the missed miles i was worried about my performance but figured wed show up and do the best we can even so i logged nearly 700 miles in training and knew that id still be able to do decently preracei actually got a sports massage the afternoon before which helped a lot after that i drove straight down to champaign im from peoria so not a long drive and went to pick up my packet before i went to my hoteli knew this would be a big event but it didnt dawn on me just how big this would be until i went to get my packet and thats when the nerves started kicking in i grabbed my packet went to the hotel to drop my stuff off then went to go get food i went to panera and got half a sandwich and half a salad added a banana and some plain bread too sat around in my room for a bit that evening realized i had too much energy and got up to go to the fitness center biked a very slow two miles then went back to my room and went to bed racei accidentally woke up at 3 am the race started at 7 i ate breakfast just a banana and an rx bar then got back in bed for an hour or so before getting back up i made sure everything was ready then looked at the course map again i didnt really have a specific goal in mind i just knew i wanted to run faster than a 320 before i left i also had had a mix of bcaa beta alanine and half a scoop of preworkout i also took imodium pills which someone from here suggested and which worked a charm let me tell youi got to the start with plenty of time to spare i got a good warmup in used the restroom one last time then went to my corral the nerves started up again but more in a oh shit its finally happening way rather than being nervous before we took off i reminded myself several times that we would take it easy the first few miles and ease into itand thats exactly what i did didnt push myself just enjoyed the scenery and crowds around us truth be told there isnt much to talk about for that

 training

i followed the hal higdon advanced half marathon training plan for the 12 weeks leading up to the race i have done two half marathons in the past but this was my first one not in the town i live in i chose the vancouver race as i thought it would be a good place to vacation and a fun race with good views i was worried about the logistics of not being in the town you live in and getting ready for a race as well as eating different types of food going to the bathroom prerace or being unfamiliar with most things in general i live in the united states and this was my first international race of any kind my goal for the race and what i have been training for was to complete the race averaging 715 per mile which would give me a total race time of around 135 i felt good mostly throughout my training and only really started to feel fatigued sluggish in general the last couple weeks of training i decided to dial back my mileage pretty conservatively in the final week and a half leading up to the race to be as rested as possible i also couldn’t decide which pair of shoes to wear either the nike zoomfly which feel big or nike pegasus 35 which fit fine but don’t feel as fast in the end i decided to wear the pegasus since that’s the shoe i have done the majority of my long runs wearing whether or not it had an effect on my time i don’t know i did two short 3 mile runs wednesday and thursday before the race on sunday to keep my legs from getting stiff

 prerace

i woke up pretty early as i was worried about going to the bathroom and getting to the race start i’m a nervous traveler and i usually overcompensate race start was 7 am i woke up at 445 to eat a banana and peanut butter i also used that time to hydrate as much as i could and use the bathroom and foam roller i got to the start at 6 and enjoyed watching everyone’s seemingly random warm up strategies luckily this race had corrals based on anticipated finish time and i was in the first one so i got to start first of course there were still people who didn’t belong in the first heat that everyone had to weave around

 race

miles 1 – 4i had made a decision to change my goal pace and see how long i could stay with the 130 group there was 10minute gulf between pace groups and 140 was too slow but 130 would be a dice roll if i could stay with them the whole way or not more on that laterthe course starts with a brief uphill out of the gate from queen elizabeth park through a neighborhood but then transitions to a downhill that lasts a little over a mile the downhill was great to start with and filled me with a lot of confidence but also is a doubleedged sword plenty of people went out blazing and then faded on some of the first hills never to be seen again the pace group went out pretty fast a lot faster than i was expecting which initially had me worried that my eyes were bigger than my stomach trying to stay with the group i decided to stick to 64550ish for the first few miles and seeing how far they would get ahead of me but i ended up catching back up with them at mile 2 after the downhill  by the time i got to the pace group it had flattened out and people were already dropping from it while i settled in the initial part of the race is really cool because we get to run across a large bridge south of town it gave great views of the city from the south and the various neighborhoods it was also fun to see the elite runners be so far ahead of everyone so quickly this section of the race ends with a pretty awkward turnaround that i hope that would change in the future you end up just making a uturn and heading back the same direction you came but on the other side of the road into chinatown having to slow down wasn’t ideal and one person slipped on gravel which had a small cascading effect on everyone around them

miles 5 – 7at this point i am solidly in the 130 pace group and feeling fantastic my heart rate was fine legs felt fine shoes felt fine everything was going great i was eating on time and everything it was also the least attractive part of the race as it’s just city running without much to look at there wasn’t a lot of supporters here as one of the areas doesn’t seem to be the nicest part of town so it got a little lonely on this stretch

miles 8 – 105this next section of the road took us into the nicer part of town along the water towards stanley park it’s also where there were some hills to contend with i was feeling great in the initial part of this section and was excited to move into the park portion of the course as it’s a really pretty area i wasn’t feeling all that fatigued at mile 8 but was definitely feeling it there was a solid group of 10 of us in the pace group at this point which had shrunken down significantly over the course of the race at around mile 95 to 10 i started to feel fatigued i had been running at a pace i wasn’t expecting to or really trained for in a longdistance setting besides tempo runs for 95 miles it was also where we began to hit some slight inclineshills and where i started having to work to keep up with the group unfortunately i started to fade from the group after another hill and just couldn’t catch them again i lingered for a while just behind them and slowly over the next mile and a half watched the gap grow you can really see my split drop here where i averaged 719 it was in pretty thick tree cover so that time may be a little off i noticed a lot of other people were struggling in this area as well never the less it was still beautiful running through the park there weren’t very many supporters in this stretch of the course so it was pretty quiet

miles 105 – 12we got out of the interior of the park and started to run to along the seawall which was awesome it gave great views of north vancouver and vancouver itself once we made it around to that side again not many supporters besides the volunteers handing out water i was still pretty fatigued but starting to get my second wind luckily i found someone who was running a similar pace as me so we ran together to pace each other i think this was a big help and helped us both keep our pace up i was pretty discouraged i lost contact with the 130 group so having him there was nice we kept reeling people in and going for the next person for most of this section there were a lot of stragglers in this section so it gave us plenty of people to go after i was definitely feeling worn out but being so close to the end i dug deep and kept my pace up

mile 13when we started the last mile of the race i could hear the announcer calling out people’s names from across the bay which was good and bad it sucked because i wasn’t done and knew how much farther i had to go but good because we were close there was definitely a lot of spectators in this section which helped to raise my energy level i was still running with my new buddythe entire last section of the race is a slight incline into the downtown finish turning the corner and seeing it rise is not the best sight the finish chute is nice and long which is fine there were a lot of people cheering everyone along i crossed the finish line with nothing left in the tank feeling really depleted but ecstatic that i was able to do so much better than i thought i would my chip was 13203 which is a 6minute pr from my previous half marathon last year

 postrace

postrace was finding my girlfriend beer bananas photos and trying to make my legs feel better unfortunately i had a flight to catch early afternoon so we didn’t stay around long had another beer at a restaurant nearby and went back to the hotel after eating overall i was really happy with my performance i was honestly surprised that i beat what i set out to do and it shows me what i can accomplish and that i was faster than i thought the majority of my training is solo so i don’t really have an opportunity to be pushed like that in groups i was somewhat disappointed with the pacing though i felt it wasn’t very consistent when i look at the splits i have no idea if that affected my performance at all but the inconsistency was a little frustrating the pacer ended up missing the time by 12 seconds as well however i was glad to have the pacer there and felt that i would have been slower without it speaking to the race it was great vancouver is an incredible city and the course shows off a lot of what the city has to offer running in and around stanley park was an amazing experience i would definitely suggest this race

 what’s next

id like to run a marathon sometime this year but havent trained for one i think if i set my goal for the fall i could be ready for it ill most likely run another half that is local to keep up race fitness while training id like to move off of the higdon plans and try pete pfitzgers plans now that ive got a good base level of fitness i enjoyed hals plan though and felt like it took me to the next level

about the logistics of not being in the town you live in and getting ready for a race as well as eating different types of food going to the bathroom prerace or being unfamiliar with most things in general i live in the united states and this was my first international race of any kind my goal for the race and what i have been training for was to complete the race averaging 715 per mile which would give me a total race time of around 135 i felt good mostly throughout my training and only really started to feel fatigued sluggish in general the last couple weeks of training i decided to dial back my mileage pretty conservatively in the final week and a half leading up to the race to be as rested as possible i also couldn’t decide which pair of shoes to wear either the nike zoomfly which feel big or nike pegasus 35 which fit fine but don’t feel as fast in the end i decided to wear the pegasus since that’s the shoe i have done the majority of my long runs wearing whether or not it had an effect on my time i don’t know i did two short 3 mile runs wednesday and thursday before the race on sunday to keep my legs from getting stiff preracei woke up pretty early as i was worried about

little over a mile the downhill was great to start with and filled me with a lot of confidence but also is a doubleedged sword plenty of people went out blazing and then faded on some of the first hills never to be seen again the pace group went out pretty fast a lot faster than i was expecting which initially had me worried that my eyes were bigger than my stomach trying to stay with the group i decided to stick to 64550ish for the first few miles and seeing how far they would get ahead of me but i ended up catching back up with them at mile 2 after the downhill  by the time i got to the pace group it had flattened out and people were already dropping from it while i settled in the initial part of the race is really cool because we get to run across a large bridge south of town it gave great views of the city from the south and the various neighborhoods it was also fun to see the elite runners be so far ahead of everyone so quickly this section of the race ends with a pretty awkward turnaround that i hope that would change in the future you end up just making a uturn and heading back the same direction you came but on the other side of the road into chinatown having to

group at this point which had shrunken down significantly over the course of the race at around mile 95 to 10 i started to feel fatigued i had been running at a pace i wasn’t expecting to or really trained for in a longdistance setting besides tempo runs for 95 miles it was also where we began to hit some slight inclineshills and where i started having to work to keep up with the group unfortunately i started to fade from the group after another hill and just couldn’t catch them again i lingered for a while just behind them and slowly over the next mile and a half watched the gap grow you can really see my split drop here where i averaged 719 it was in pretty thick tree cover so that time may be a little off i noticed a lot of other people were struggling in this area as well never the less it was still beautiful running through the park there weren’t very many supporters in this stretch of the course so it was pretty quietmiles 105 – 12we got out of the interior of the

volunteers handing out water i was still pretty fatigued but starting to get my second wind luckily i found someone who was running a similar pace as me so we ran together to pace each other i think this was a big help and helped us both keep our pace up i was pretty discouraged i lost contact with the 130 group so having him there was nice we kept reeling people in and going for the next person for most of this section there were a lot of stragglers in this section so it gave us plenty of people to go after i was definitely feeling worn out but being so close to the end i dug deep and kept

last section of the race is a slight incline into the downtown finish turning the corner and seeing it rise is not the best sight the finish chute is nice and long which is fine there were a lot of

 background
this is my 3rd marathon in my extremely petty desire to beat my boss’ marathon time from the late 70s i started at 30447 in the la marathon last year then went to 30014 in the two cities marathon later the same year and now trying my hand at the avenue of the giants marathon in humboldt california

a little background i’m 29 male i used to recently was promoted out work an incredibly stressful job as an assistant to a very powerful person i put my best face on every day i took the remarks the anger the demeaning tasks and the waking up in the middle of the night to panic attacks and dread all in stride underneath that brewed a sharp desire he was a big runner back in his day and was a pretty good marathoner 245 at boston maybe it was just a way to destress or find a hobby that gave me some kind of sense of accomplishment but throughout this job i found running and never looked back this is my third marathon and while i’m starting at a much less experienced point than he was and with considerably less talent i am trying to slowly climb to his heights


 training
i did an 1885 pfitz program since i really pooped out at mile 20 in both of my last two marathons for the first 2 and a half months the training was going great i really hated the midweek 15 mile runs that eventually come my jobs hours are no fun 7am7pm most days but i was feeling as strong as i ever had then my right foot starting acting up then my right achilles followed suit then after a random fall on a morning run my hip really hurt like full on injury and not tendinitis or soreness i took the first week of taper completely off and only lightly jogged in my final week i went into the race with reservations and fully expected to drop midrace once i felt the pain in my hip

 prerace
right away the avenue of the giants became my favorite marathon i’ve done so far it’s all so handmade and kitschy in the best ways the area is gorgeous and everyone involved is so welcoming and kind and takes everything very seriously highly recommend for anyone 

i talked to a few guys at the line asking what times they were after and nearly everyone i asked said “oh around 3 just under 3” perfect that’s what i’m going for

 race
well i dunno what they were on about because that group went out at 618  it was quick and i decided to take a step back and stay around 635640 pace early the first half went great and i pulled in with my fastest half marathon ever at 12505 problem was right around mile 6 i started feeling my hip i made myself a promise that i’d only drop out if i felt a sharp serious pain and not just a growing tightness or soreness still as i passed the finish line to my left at 131 miles and started out on the second loop i definitely had the thought to end it there it wasnt debilitating yet though so i had to truck on each mile itd get tighter id get more and more sure it was going to give out but it never quite got there 

it was at mile 20 that i finally took in the fact that i was going to finish under 3 and in my mind qualify for the 2020 boston marathon the next 6 miles were excruciating in pain but i was ecstatic i had done something i didnt think i could do and the failure of my previous marathon was going to be erased i pushed the last 400 meters or so and came in for a sprint finish despite my pain i could barely walk afterwards but i was truly proud of myself in a way i hadnt been in a while in a year and 2 months i had gone from marathon novice to sub3 hours

welllllll do your research first buddy dont know why i didnt assume bq would drop 5 minutes again but looks like it will so i didnt qualify for boston im not gonna get that shot to beat my boss time there just yet but it exists on the horizon still and maybe ill figure out another way there any suggestions

 background
last july i signed up for the bsim locals lottery in the middle of the build to ironman 703 santa rosa the race is iconic and living with it on my doorstep left me with no excuse not to at least try and register i decided that if i were chosen id make the marathon my first a race of the season and really test my ability as a runner before this race i had only ever run 262 miles as the final leg of ironman arizona in november of 2018 i finished the 2018 season with plenty of overeating and excessive drinking surrounding the holidays then started to think about what i needed to do to begin training for the marathon i worked with a triathlon coach during 2018 but had already decided not to work with them any longer for various reasons however after only a couple weeks on my own i realized that i push myself way harder and hold myself more accountable when working with a coach i found another i trusted who is a strong runner and spoke with them about the potential of training for a marathon while still keeping my bike and swim fitness they were up for the challenge and we started working together with the idea that wed shift the focus back to triathlon after 42819

 training
as i mentioned i worked with a coach throughout my training for this race this at least personally was imperative to my ability to perform how i did if you asked me on january 1st what my goal time for the big sur marathon was youd likely get an answer like if i break 330 ill be ecstatic i also would have considered running a bq time unattainable at least until i got older and could qualify in 320 or something my coach constantly pushed me out of my comfort zone and the validation  gratification i got from their positive feedback after a hard run was a huge motivator

my general training week consisted of
 day  workout 1  workout 2
 monday  rest   
 tuesday  masters swim  bike hills or short intervals 
 wednesday  masters swim  tempo run 
 thursday  masters swim  treadmill recovery run 
 friday  track workout 
 saturday  bike 6090 minutes usually very easy 
 sunday  long run   

during the biggest training weeks run volume got up to 4045 miles i also swam between 5500 and 7500 yards weekly and rode 2040 miles depending on the focus of the week i know that run mileage is pretty low compared to faster athletes and id be interested in how well i could perform on 6070 mile weeks and how well my body would handle the load 

 course description  race strategy
the big sur course is known for being brutal with about 2200ft of elevation gain but a net loss of 350ft there are very few sections of the course that are flat add a potential for intense headwinds and most people end up with a finish time anywhere from 1030 minutes slower than their marathon pr there is one infamous climb to hurricane point is 600ft over 2 miles with various false summits that are known for draining motivation between miles 10 and 12

considering all of these variables along with this being my first marathon i was nervous about my ability to go at a smart and sustainable pace after discussing with my coach we decided that going with the 310 pace group for the first half of the race would be a good idea that would take me over hurricane point at ideally a pace that would leave plenty of gas in the tank for the rest of the race if i was feeling good after the first 131 we planned on increasing my pace slightly pulling away from the group and finishing somewhere between 305 and 310 the most important metric however was heart rate i was to stay in midzone 3 except on any climbs where that wasnt possible essentially the plan was nothing over 165 except on the big climbs

 prerace
my last few workouts didnt go as well as many of my other runs did throughout the training block my hr was higher than i expected it to be but i tried not to let it get to me nerves didnt really kick in until the day before the race during a qa with some of the past winners at the expo nervous energy filled the room and sitting close to the front i felt like everyone was breathing it down my neck my partners mother was in town they were both a part of a 4 person marathon relay its really great having other people in my life devoted to endurance sports but hosting people during a race weekend is definitely an added stressor i made everyone a pasta dinner at 6pm saturday night had a glass of wine and tried to go to bed wed be leaving at 330am to catch the bus to the starting line luckily im a pretty good sleeper and didnt have much issue getting a good nights rest we woke up had some overnight oats and a cup of coffee grabbed all the essentials and headed out

the bus ride to the start line was where i started getting really nervous  we were basically driving the course backward and i was visualizing every step we got to the start village and settled in for a little more than an hour of waiting before we lined up at the starting line there was no coffee left which was probably for the better but it didnt help the wait go by any quicker around 630 we started lining up i got up towards the front with the 310 crew and counted down the minutes to the start

 miles 1 to 10
the first 56 miles are all downhill we took off and did our first 10k in 42 minutes my heart rate was already high sometimes higher than my 165 limit already even going downhill i decided to stop even looking at my watch and just hang with the group we settled into a more sustainable pace after the first 6 miles but my heart rate seemed like it might stay around 170 for the whole race i wondered a bit about my ability to keep that up for all 262 miles but i decided to just say fuck it and figure out what i was capable of we turned the corner just beyond point sur lighthouse and could see the infamous hurricane point climb the is a little descent for about a quartermile just before the climb starts and one other guy started to pull away im not sure why but i decided that i wanted to go with him that was the last time i saw the 310 group

 miles 10 to 131
my new friend and i both looked at our watches as we passed the 10mile mark and took off up the hill the first mile is significantly steeper than the second which was something i wasnt aware of we passed one of the most memorable musical groups on the course  the taiko drums and soon after my watch let me know that we were halfway through the climb in just over 8 minutes we continued pushing the grade let up a little and we were at the top before we knew it what i thought would be the most difficult 2 miles were done and i was still feeling great heart rate was still way high but whatever i was going to be fine we flew down the back side of the hill in 620 and i crossed the 131 marker in something like 134

 miles 131 to 22
this section is one of the lonelier sections on the course there arent really any spectators throughout the race because the road is closed but this section is particularly long and can be boring this was when my friend and i spoke for the first and essentially only time his name is josh and this was his 4th or 5th time running the race he was hoping to break 310 something he hadnt ever done that sounded perfect to me and i was glad that i had decided to go with him despite the fact that he pushed me a little harder than i thought i should have been going at numerous points throughout the race we kept the splits between 645 and 710 during this section depending on how hilly it was i was starting to feel fatigued by about mile 16 or 17 but i told myself that i could do a 10miler in my sleep i was almost at the home stretch when we passed mile marker 20 i was definitely hurting but 10k was easy  45 minutes to go lets do this

 miles 22 to finish
i dont know why i was under the impressing that if i could get over hurricane point that i was basically finished that climb was nothing compared to miles 2225 the carmel highlands its rolling hills with 34 pretty significant climbs and camber that causes lots of people to crowd the middle line or run off to the side of the road i was hurting pretty bad at this point and my heart rate was 170180 with 30 minutes left to go i didnt know if i was going to make it without having to stop or slow down significantly josh started to pull away around mile 22 and i literally couldnt move any faster to hang with him i watched him get further and further away and realized that i was on my own until the finish i kept it consistent in those final few miles but the climb that happens right at mile 25 was a huge low point its only about a quartermile but it felt miserable i looked down at my watch and realized that i was only going to miss the 305 mark slightly i heard the announcer at the finish chute calling out names and i sprinted to the finish probably didnt move any faster than i was already going haha i crossed the finish line and felt like i was going to fall over my gas tank was totally empty absolutely nothing left

 postrace
i went straight into the massage tent  a huge plus of finishing in the top 100 is that there wasnt a wait yet afterward i grabbed my postrace beer and waited with a friend for my partner and her mom to get to the finish village i was on cloud 9 feeling like i accomplished my goal of breaking 310 and since i gave all i had to give i couldnt have been more satisfied with a time of 30545 we got nachos and beers at a local spot then picked up some cbd bath bombs and a massive pizza to aid with recovery i had to replace the 3000 calories i burned with something right

something i keep saying thats hard to fathom for some people and would have been for me before the race is that this marathon was harder than the 11hour ironman i did in november staying at an elevated heart rate for 11 hours was really hard but my average hr at imaz was something like 145 at the big sur marathon my hr avg was 174 which was so hard if you had told me at 630 on race morning that i was going to spend 3 hours in zone 4 i would have said fuck you no way the human body is capable of incredible things i couldnt be more proud of my performance and i cant thank the people who supported me on the journey enough  two people especially my partner and my coach

 whats next
im still figuring out what the rest of my season looks like since we will likely be moving in the next few months im definitely planning on an ironman 703 event in august or september probably boulder or santa cruz im also really intrigued by the idea of running a trail race possibly an ultramarathon a 100miler is definitely on my bucket list but thats probably something for a few years from now before that i have a few other goals on my list
1 qualify for the boston marathon  ill probably attempt this at the california international marathon in sacramento this december potentially qualifying for 2021
2 subgoal  if i qualify i think ill try to do the boston to big sur challenge that year 2 marathons in 13 days on opposite sides of the country
3 qualify for ironman 703 world championships  this is a new one so well see if its possible

definitely a special thanks to the rrunning and rtriathlon communities for keeping me motivated and working hard follow me on instagramhttpswwwinstagramcomfitfastfar and stravahttpswwwstravacomathletes26870080 if youre interested

his name is josh and this was his 4th or 5th time running the race he was hoping to break 310 something he hadnt ever done that sounded perfect to me and i was glad that i had decided to go with him despite the fact that he pushed me a little harder than i thought i should have been going at numerous points throughout the race we kept the splits between 645 and 710 during this section depending on how hilly it was i was starting to feel fatigued by about mile 16 or 17 but i told myself that i could do a 10miler in my sleep i was almost at the home stretch when we passed mile marker 20 i was definitely hurting but 10k was easy  45 minutes to go lets do this miles 22 to finishi dont know why i was under the impressing that if i could get over hurricane point that i was basically finished

josh started to pull away around mile 22 and i literally couldnt move any faster to hang with him i watched him get further and further away and realized that i was on my own until the finish i kept it consistent in those final few miles but the climb that happens right at mile 25 was a huge low point its only about a quartermile but it felt miserable i looked down at my watch and realized that i was only going to miss the 305 mark slightly i heard the announcer at the finish chute calling out names and i sprinted to the finish probably didnt move any faster than i was already going haha i

i started running in april of last year with rc25k followed by rb210k  in november i decided i was going to run this half i felt like i had a decent amount of time before the half so i didnt really follow a training plan i looked at hal higdon and the nike training plan and tried to model my training after that but honestly i usually ran 3 days a week a 5k speed run regular pace 5k or 10k and a long run i was very relaxed about my training for the most part i did probably half of my long runs on a hilly trail that was probably the most beneficial part of my training i did some 8 milers some 10s and a 131 prior to the race four weeks out i started to get some bad knee pain and so my last month was more two days a week of running than three and i missed my last two weeks of long runs  


 prerace  
the week leading up to the race i upped my carbs slightly 180200g per day and ran 23 miles each day but took saturday off and just tried to get 10000 steps in and did some yoga 

the day before meals

breakfast bacon egg and cheese on toasted everything bagel

lunch turkey burger no bunno cheese and sweet potato fries

dinner gnocchi and chicken with vodka sauce

dessert 12 pint halo top

i made sure to sleep in a bed by myself the night before so my partner didnt wake me up at all 

woke up at 5 am had some oatmeal around 530am and a banana approx 7 am 730 am race start for reference  


 race  
the race overall was a great experience i had a lot of fun it was a bit harder than expected since i had ran the 131 before but this was a bit more overwhelming and my legs were unforgiving towards the end still really happy and proud of myself for finishing a half marathon was never something i thought i could accomplish ever  


 miles 1 to 10  
miles 110 felt pretty good i felt confident i was going to finish i realized quickly that my fitbit mileage was ahead of the mile markers which was quite frustrating drizzles here and there   


 miles 11 to 13  
hit a wall at this point it started raining pretty hard and consistent quads felt super heavy and tired i stopped for the first time at mile 11 and a few more times until the end i had a horrible cramp in my quad that i had to massage out and spent some time stretching and walking   


 postrace  
celebrated with family and friends nearby recovered with a yogurt parfait a mimosa and bacon its always tough for me to eat after a long run as i felt pretty nauseous and had a headache but was happy to celebrate lots of foam rolling and icyhot post race i took mon and tues off from the gym and will be back today wed  


 whats next  
i am going to spend the springsummer focusing more on weight lifting with one short run and one long run a week in the fall ill think about doing another half i will probably try to do more speed runs and different splits to get faster

 tldr summary at the end

nbsp

 background

in 2017 i ran 2 of the 6 world major marathons boston and chicago sometime last year as i was contemplating the seemingly impossible lottery odds for the remaining marathons i stumbled upon a slight loophole for tokyo like all of the world majors you can bypass the lottery andor time requirements by raising money for charity but unlike the others the fundraising requirement for tokyo is much easier its just 100000 yen or about 900 i signed up and simply considered this part of my expenses to travel to japan and run this race

you can choose from several official charities to support i selected peace winds japanhttpspeacewindsorgpwen and their project to rescue rehabilitate and train stray dogs to become service dogs

 goals

 goal  description 

 minimum  32000 
 primary  31000 
 stretch  30624 
 streeetch  30447 
 streeeeeeeetch  30000 

my primary goal for this race was to qualify for boston 310 for me ive qualified once before but that was on a net downhill course tokyo is basically flat so i felt that a bq here would be more of an accomplishment

barring that i felt that 320 was a safe minimum goal for my fitness and experience the only way i wouldnt hit this would be if i got injured

i also had 3 stretch goals none of which were must accomplish all would be simply cool and kind of fun if i pulled them off i knew that the biggest stretch goal sub3 would require a perfect race and would be highly unlikely thats fine the other two had a bit of backstory to them

my first bq mentioned above was a 30447 on a downhill course in 2016httpswwwredditcomrrunningcomments4zo609racereportsupertunnelmarathonbqattempt2 a friend of mine ran this same course in 2018 and throughout his training cycle he was obsessed with beating my time a lot of fun banter was had as a result he didnt beat it but came close at 30624 nevermind that hes 11 years older than me and definitely beat me in age grading so for tokyo my first two stretch goals were to beat these two times on the flat less forgiving course

nbsp

 training

my training cycle for this marathon was a first i actually followed a training plan and stuck to it mostly

a friend who also ran tokyo via charity had a 16week training plan made up by a coaching service the plan was based on hansons method each week there was a speed workout monday strength or tempo workout thursday and long run saturday along with easy runs or rest days on the other days of the week most of us in our friend group were either running tokyo march 3 la march 24 or boston april 15 all 3 weeks apart those targeting the latter races simply offset the schedule by 3 or 6 weeks each week we got together most days to run our respective workouts together even if we all had different intervals or target race paces some days wed only see each other at the start and finish of the run but it worked and it really helped with accountability

runs were broken into 5 pace categories depending on the schedule

 speed marathon pace mp minus 55 secondsmile
 strength mp  10smile
 tempo mp
 long mp  30smile or slower
 easy mp  60smile or slower

for my primary goal that put my training paces at

 speed 615mile
 strength 700mile
 tempo 710mile
 long 740mile
 easy 810mile

in reality i ran most of my speedstrengthtempo workouts at 520smile faster than prescribed and the longeasy runs 30s to 2 minutes per mile slower than listed above for the workouts most days i was so afraid of getting tired and running out of steam that i always ended up running a little too fast the long and easy runs were typically done in a group at whatever pace everyone else was going this could range from 800 to 1000mile

in the end i dont think that these deviations caused any harm the important thing is running paces that stimulate the desired type of physiological development while not being overly taxing or causing injury a few seconds here or there wont change this in a measurable way

the one exception to following the plan was december on december 1st i tripped on a curb and banged up my right knee while i still kept my daily running streak going i basically ignored the training schedule for about 3 weeks as i let my knee heal with only short and easy 12 mile runs i wondered how this would affect my preparedness for the race but thankfully it was early in the cycle

even after losing most of december to the knee this training cycle was by far my most solid in the past ive always avoided speedwork because that almost inevitably led to injury with the exception of those 3 weeks i ran every workout at the paces discussed above i also ran extra miles on the easy and rest days i didnt take a day off completely keeping the run streak going and averaged about 65 milesweek in january and february again in the past this volume of miles inevitably led to injury after 23 weeks but not this time

i think i can mostly attribute the lack of overtraining injury to the fact that i had a better base going into this cycle in late november i had been running every day since the previous april giving me 7 months of a solid  but not too strenuous  base that and constant prehab particularly focused on my chronic peroneal tendonitis which was always there throughout but always under control

we had an unusually rainy season in southern california so several key workouts were done in the pouring rain this would end up being helpful on race day

nbsp

 prerace organized chaos

we left los angeles on thursday february 28 arriving in tokyo the following evening nothing really of note here just getting from the airport to our hotel and a quick evening streak run in the nearby shinjuku chuo park

on saturday we met our friends who were also there for the marathon and ran the tokyo friendship runhttpswwwmarathontokyoeneventsfriendshiprun 21 miles untimed this was a nice shakeout before the marathon and a fun little event we then headed to the marathon expo for packet pickup the line to get in was very longhttpsiimgurcomfz1otwtjpg the japanese seem to love waiting in line but moved quickly along with the race bib timing shoe tag its been several years since ive seen one of these and other materials each runner was given a wristband with a chip after verifying identity no wristband no entrance into the start corral the following morning

charity runners got 2 shirts the official race shirt and a charity shirt to pick up the latter you had to stop by the booth for your chosen charity which was cool peace winds japan had one of their rescue dogshttpsiimgurcomvvwi2znjpg at the booth and it was super cute

the forecast for race morning changed quite a bit leading up to the day alternating between rain starting around noon when i hoped to finish and rain all morning what we got was a light and steady rain all morning thus i would bring a throwaway poncho to keep myself dry while waiting to start as we had to be in the start area almost an hour before race time temperature was around 50f10c

race morning i got up around 630 to get dressed and had a couple pastries from the 7eleven down in the hotel basement convenience store food in japan is seriously really good way better than in the us i left the room around 745 to head down to the start area my hotel was just a block from my entrance gate to the start area should be plenty of time before the 815 closure of the start gates right wrong

the japanese are masters at what i like to call organized chaos the start area was a perfect example of that there were 11 start blocks corrals 5 entrance gates and countless gear bag trucks all in a downtown area 34 city blocks on a side with highrise buildings and multiple street levels what looked simple on the map was anything but i was quickly turned around with no sense of direction and starting to panic that i couldnt see any signs pointing to gate 3 runners wouldnt be allowed in via any entrance other than the one they were assigned to the japanese love to follow rules

i found an information tent and was able to get directions to my gate from someone speaking english getting there involved going up stairs walking a block over turning and going another block and then going down stairs to an underground area simple right signs for gate 3 didnt start to appear until already getting closer to the area i found that this was common in japan when looking for signs with directions

i barely made it to my gate before the 815 cutoff i dont know how strict they were with this and there were a lot of other runners in the same situation from this point security checked our gear bags and wristbands before we made our way back onto the street now on the lower level gear bag dropoff was at the next intersection where dozens of numbered trucks lined the street and thousands of runners milled about trying to find their assigned truck again signs and balloons theoretically directed you to the right truck but they were often not seen until you were already going in the right direction

after finding my truck and dropping off my gear bag full of dry clothes all in ziploc bags to keep them dry it was back up the stairs to the upper level street for the start blocks at this point i had some time before the 845 cutoff to get in start blocks i didnt need to use the portapotties good thing long lines but well organized with a volunteer directing people in line so i hung out under a building overhang to try to stay dry and clear of the breeze i tried to do some dynamic stretches in what little room i had among the many other runners huddled here then at 840 made my way into my assigned start block b

we still had lots of waiting time before the 910 start there was some pomp and circumstance mostly in japanese before the starting gun went off there was no wave start  everyone moved toward the start line and got going i crossed the start line 134 after the gun my friend in start block e was just a few minutes behind i tossed my poncho and stuffed it out of the way of subsequent runners as i approached the start line many others kepts theirs on but the rain was fairly light

nbsp

 race

the first 45 miles out of the shinjuku ward are a very slight downhill losing about 100 feet in total elevation from there the course is almost completely flat save for periodic overpasses and their slight climbsdescents

i wanted to take advantage of the decline at the start by going a little faster than my goal pace about 710mile however this was made more difficult by the fact that many people who started ahead of me were going slower clearly they should have been assigned later start blocks and im not sure why they werent perhaps estimated times or past race times werent verified bottom line is more extra energy than expected was spent dodging slower runners the first few miles given the japanese reputation for following rules this surprised me i would say the crowd didnt thin out until around mile 5 or so

initially i was afraid i had put on too much clothing  2 layers of tshirts arm warmers gloves tights and shorts i was a little warm the first few miles however soon i was glad to have the layers as water soaked through by the last 56 miles i was getting a little cold

one challenge with the rain was slippery footing the asphalt in general was fine no issues but i quickly learned to avoid any painted lines as these areas could be quite slick especially the large painted rectangles marking crosswalks at some points and levels of fatigue this was easier said than done yet another obstacle to maneuver around

aid stations had water and pocari sweat  a japanese sports drink that is basically like the colorless cloudy variety of gatorade they have funny names for things some aid stations had tables and volunteers on both sides of the road but some didnt and i missed at least one by assuming it would be on the right we ran on the left side of the road just as the japanese drive on the left so all aid stations were at least available on the left they seemed to be a little less frequent than in many other marathons but the runners handbook said they had 15 stations i took 12 cups of pocari sweat whenever possible and tried to drink while running this usually worked though i got a lot on my shirt but with the rain who cares once i got it in my eye and that stung a little like sweat

i stayed ahead of pace through about 17 miles or so after this point as youll see below my legs started to slow as they protested around mile 23 my right hamstring threatened mutiny but i kept it in check the left soon followed but quieted down quickly still i was continually slowing as the later miles became a difficult slog i kept checking my watch to make sure i still had margin to slow down a bit more as would likely occur

everything hurt my breathing was becoming increasingly labored it was getting cold as everything was soaked and the wind started to pick up i just told myself to keep pushing ive watched goals slip away in other races when my body had hit its limit and didnt want the same to happen here just keep pushing

the last 10k was mostly a looooong out and back that seemed to go on forever actually the majority of the coursehttpswwwmarathontokyoenaboutcourse is a series of a few long outandbacks but soon signs started appearing to announce 5k to go 2k to go 1k to go that final kilometer was literally the longest ive ever run technically also the shortest my legs were tight and screaming i was cold and wet selfinflicted brutality

we ran down this brick street in the final kilometer though in true japanese fashion it was a much smoother surface than a european cobblestone street finally we turned left at tokyo station and there it was the finish line i focused in on it and gave one final push

i will say that the spectators were amazing i cant think of a single part of the course where they werent lined 34 deep and cheering enthusiastically all out in the rain when they could have been nice and cozy indoors somewhere the people of tokyo were awesome

 postrace

we walked for what seemed like forever to get through the finish chute and even just to the part where they handed out towels and space blankets it was seriously the longest finish chute ive ever experienced by far rain was starting to pick up a little bit and similar to the start area different runners were assigned different paths through the finish area based on bib color the volunteers however were great helping runners who struggled to keep their space blankets on as we made our way through we picked up all of the postrace goodies our gear bags and last but not least our finisher medalshttpsiimgurcomusctczijpg

at the end of the chute we were directed into a building where there was a huge changing room on the 5th floor for charity runners i dont know if all runners had this in various nearby buildings but it was heaven warm and dry who cares that there was no privacy i made my way to an empty spot in the far corner and began to use my cold fingers to untie my gear bag the finisher towel immediately became useful both to dry off and eventually for a small amount of modesty to change into dry underwear

after about 30 minutes of warming up and slowly getting into dry clothes i was ready to go back out and meet my wife  my friends wife my friend finished about an hour behind me so we waited for him and then had lunch in the area

nbsp

for a little over 2 weeks my wife and i traveled around japan and had an amazing vacation hence the delay on this race report we spent time in tokyo kyoto hiroshima and surrounding areas there was a ton of walking throughout and the japanese do not shy away from stairs we loved japan and simply cant say enough good things about it those interested can view my japan trip report herehttpswwwredditcomrjapantravelcommentsb6y4fptripreport19daysinjapantokyokyoto

while waiting for my friend to finish we met a british runner who had gotten separated from his group and had a dead phone battery while letting him borrow one of ours to contact friends we learned that he had arrived in tokyo the previous afternoon and was flying back home that night what folks dont do this when you run tokyo marathon or any destination race do it as we did and spend time enjoying the amazing country afterwards

nbsp

postrace the one body part that has been problematic is my right knee i think it was related to the tight hamstring late in the race and pushing through that also residual weakness from the fall in december may have been a factor even my foot with its chronic tendonitis was pretty much back to normal the next day

i kept up my running streak throughout the trip but the knee limited my distance mostly 12 mile easy runs i was a little disappointed that i didnt get to runsplore more but my knee was having a hard enough time with the walking and stair climbing its still giving me problems 3 weeks later so the prescription for the immediate future is rest rest rest

nbsp

 thoughts

this was easily my strongest marathon performance out of 13 so far i attribute this to the training plan and mileage and consider it quite successful even so i suffered in the last 78 miles and slowed down what would have prevented that slowdown

 i feel that the workout paces were appropriate for my ability and goal and probably didnt need changing
 my best guess is that increased mileage would have helped prepare my legs to maintain pace over those last several miles perhaps 80 miles per week would have gotten me there of course this carries the risk of overuse injury and im not sure that my body was ready for such volume anyway
 did the 3 weeks in december make a difference hard to tell since it was early in the cycle perhaps the relative rest allowed me to train better in january and february or maybe i lost a little bit of potential fitness who knows
 did i go out too fast i honestly didnt feel like the fatigue in the later miles was due to going too fast early on the first 23rds were pretty comfortable my gut feeling is that going out at target pace or easier going for a negative split would have likely resulted in missing my goal as my legs still would have tired and slowed down
 the rain may have played a small role in slowing me down but i do feel that the cool temperature helped so im not sure if the weather helped or hurt overall a cloudy but dry day at a similar temperature would have been ideal sunny may have been too warm

nbsp

 whats next

the only thing on my race calendar is new york marathon in november i got in on time with a half marathon  another lottery bypassed thatll be my 4th world major hopefully the knee will heal up in the next month or so and ill be able to get back to real training soon

california so several key workouts were done in the pouring rain this would end up being helpful on race daynbsp prerace organized chaoswe left los angeles on thursday february 28 arriving in tokyo the following evening nothing really of note here just getting from the airport to our hotel and a quick evening streak run in the nearby shinjuku chuo parkon saturday we met our friends who were also there for the marathon and ran the tokyo friendship runhttpswwwmarathontokyoeneventsfriendshiprun 21 miles untimed this was a nice shakeout before the marathon and a fun little event we then headed to the marathon expo for packet pickup the line to get in was very longhttpsiimgurcomfz1otwtjpg the japanese seem to love waiting in line but moved quickly along with the race bib timing shoe tag its been several years since ive seen one of these and other materials each runner was given a wristband with a chip after verifying identity no wristband no entrance into the start corral the following morningcharity runners got 2 shirts the official race shirt and a charity shirt to pick up the latter you had to stop by the booth for your chosen charity which was cool peace winds japan had one of their rescue dogshttpsiimgurcomvvwi2znjpg at the booth and it was super cutethe forecast for race morning changed quite a bit leading up to the day alternating between rain starting around noon when i hoped to finish and rain all morning what we got was a light and steady rain all morning thus i would bring a throwaway poncho to keep myself dry while waiting to start as we had to be in the start area almost an hour before race time temperature was around 50f10crace morning i got up around 630 to get dressed and had a couple pastries from the 7eleven down in the hotel basement convenience store food in japan is seriously really good way better than in the us i left the room around 745 to head down to the start area my hotel was just a block from my entrance gate to the start area should be plenty of time before the 815 closure of the start gates right wrongthe japanese are masters at what i like to call organized chaos the start area was a perfect example of that there were 11 start blocks corrals 5 entrance gates and countless gear bag trucks all in a downtown area 34 city blocks on a side with highrise buildings and multiple street levels what looked simple on the map was anything but i was quickly turned around with no sense of direction and starting to panic that i couldnt see any signs pointing to gate 3 runners wouldnt be allowed in via any entrance other than the one they were assigned to the japanese love to follow rulesi found an information tent and was able to get directions to my gate from someone speaking english getting there involved going up stairs walking a block over turning and going another block and then going down stairs to an underground area simple right signs for gate 3 didnt start to appear until already getting closer to the area i found that this was common in japan when looking for signs with directionsi barely made it to my gate before the 815 cutoff i dont know how strict they were with this and there were a lot of other runners in the same situation from this point security checked our gear bags and wristbands before we made our way back onto the street now on the lower level gear bag dropoff was at the next intersection where dozens of numbered trucks lined the street and thousands of runners milled about trying to find their assigned truck again signs and balloons theoretically directed you to the right truck but they were often not seen until you were already going in the right directionafter finding my truck and dropping off my gear bag full of dry clothes all in ziploc bags to keep them dry it was back up the stairs to the upper level street for the start blocks at this point i had some time before the 845 cutoff to get in start blocks i didnt need to use the portapotties good thing long lines but well organized with a volunteer directing people in line so i hung out under a building overhang to try to stay dry and clear of the breeze i tried to do some dynamic stretches in what little room i had among the many other runners huddled here then at 840 made my way into my assigned start block bwe still had lots of waiting time before the 910 start there was some pomp and circumstance mostly in japanese before the starting gun went off there was no wave start  everyone moved toward the start line and got going i crossed the start line 134 after the gun my friend in start block e was just a few minutes behind i tossed my poncho and stuffed it out of the way of subsequent runners as i approached the start line many others kepts theirs on but the rain was fairly lightnbsp racethe first 45 miles out of the shinjuku ward are a very slight downhill losing about 100 feet in total elevation from there the course is almost completely flat save for periodic overpasses and their slight climbsdescentsi wanted to take advantage of the decline at the start by going a little faster than my goal pace about 710mile however this was made more difficult by the fact that many people who started ahead of me were going slower clearly they should have been assigned later start blocks and im not sure why they werent perhaps estimated times or past race times werent verified bottom line is more extra energy than expected was spent dodging slower runners the first few miles given the japanese reputation for following rules this surprised me i would say the crowd didnt thin out until around mile 5 or soinitially i was afraid i had put on too much clothing  2 layers of tshirts arm warmers gloves tights and shorts i was a little warm the first few miles however soon i was glad to have the layers as water soaked through by the last 56 miles i was getting a little coldone challenge with the rain was slippery footing the asphalt in general was fine no issues but i quickly learned to avoid any painted lines as these areas could be quite slick especially the large painted rectangles marking crosswalks at some points and levels of fatigue this was easier said than done yet another obstacle to maneuver aroundaid stations had water and pocari sweat  a japanese sports drink that is basically like the colorless cloudy variety of gatorade they have funny names for things some aid stations had tables and volunteers on both sides of the road but some didnt and i missed at least one by assuming it would be on the right we ran on the left side of the road just as the japanese drive on the left so all aid stations were at least available on the left they seemed to be a little less frequent than in many other marathons but the runners handbook said they had 15 stations i took 12 cups of pocari sweat whenever possible and tried to drink while running this usually worked though i got a lot on my shirt but with the rain who cares once i got it in my eye and that stung a little like sweati stayed ahead of pace through about 17 miles or so after this point as youll see below my legs started to slow as they protested around mile 23 my right hamstring threatened mutiny but i kept it in check the left soon followed but quieted down quickly still i was continually slowing as the later miles became a difficult slog i kept checking my watch to make sure i still had margin to slow down a bit more as would likely occureverything hurt my breathing was becoming increasingly labored it was getting cold as everything was soaked and the wind started to pick up i just told myself to keep pushing ive watched goals slip away in other races when my body had hit its limit and didnt want the same to happen here just keep pushingthe last 10k was mostly a looooong out and back that seemed to go on forever actually the majority of the coursehttpswwwmarathontokyoenaboutcourse is a series of a few long outandbacks but soon signs started appearing to announce 5k to go 2k to go 1k to go that final kilometer was literally the longest ive ever run technically also the shortest my legs were tight and screaming i was cold and wet selfinflicted brutalitywe ran down this brick street in the final kilometer though in true japanese fashion it was a much smoother surface than a european cobblestone street finally we turned left at tokyo station and there it was the finish line i focused in on it and gave one final pushi will say that the spectators were amazing i cant think of a single part of the course where they werent lined 34 deep and cheering enthusiastically all out in the rain when they could have been nice and cozy indoors somewhere the people of tokyo were awesomenbsp splits mile  time  1  07246  2  06424  3  06465  4  06534

the longest finish chute ive ever experienced by far rain was starting to pick up a little bit and similar to the start area different runners were assigned different paths through the finish area based on bib color the volunteers however were great helping runners who struggled to keep their space blankets on as we made our way through we picked up all of the postrace goodies our gear bags and last but not least our finisher medalshttpsiimgurcomusctczijpgat the end of the chute we were directed into a building where there was a huge changing room on the 5th floor for charity runners i dont know if all runners had this in various nearby buildings but it was heaven warm and dry who cares that there was no privacy i made my way to an empty spot in the far corner and began to use my cold fingers to untie my gear bag the finisher towel immediately became useful both to dry off and eventually for a small amount of modesty to change into dry underwearafter about 30 minutes of warming up and slowly getting into dry clothes i was ready to go back out and meet my wife  my friends wife my friend finished about an hour behind me so we waited for him and then had lunch in the areanbspfor a little over 2 weeks my wife and i traveled around japan and had an amazing vacation hence the delay on this race report we spent time in tokyo kyoto hiroshima and surrounding areas there was a ton of walking throughout and the japanese do not shy away from stairs we loved japan and simply cant say enough good things about it those interested can view my japan trip report herehttpswwwredditcomrjapantravelcommentsb6y4fptripreport19daysinjapantokyokyotowhile waiting for my friend to finish we met a british runner who had gotten separated from his group and had a dead phone battery while letting him borrow one of ours to contact friends we learned that he had arrived in tokyo the previous afternoon and was flying back home that night what folks dont do this when you run tokyo marathon or any destination race do it as we did and spend time enjoying the amazing country afterwardsnbsppostrace the one body part that has been problematic is my right knee i think it was related to the tight hamstring late in the race and pushing through that also residual weakness from the fall in december may have been a factor even my foot with its chronic tendonitis was pretty much back to normal the next dayi kept up my running streak throughout the trip but the knee limited my distance mostly 12 mile easy runs i was a little disappointed that i didnt get to runsplore more but my knee was having a hard enough time with the walking and stair climbing its still giving me problems 3 weeks later so the prescription for the immediate future is rest rest restnbsp thoughtsthis was easily my strongest marathon performance out of 13 so far i attribute this to the training plan and mileage and consider it quite successful even so i suffered in the last 78 miles and slowed down what would have prevented that slowdown i feel that the workout paces were appropriate for my ability and goal and probably didnt need changing my best guess is that increased mileage would have helped prepare my legs to maintain pace over those last several miles perhaps 80 miles per week would have gotten me there of course this carries the risk of overuse injury and im not sure that my body was ready for such volume anyway did the 3 weeks in december make a difference hard to tell since it was early in the cycle perhaps the relative rest allowed me to train better in january and february or maybe i lost a little bit of potential fitness who knows did i go out too fast i honestly didnt feel like the fatigue in the later miles was due to going too fast early on the first 23rds were pretty comfortable my gut feeling is that going out at target pace or easier going for a negative split would have likely resulted in missing my goal as my legs still would have tired and slowed down the rain may have played a small role in slowing me down but i do feel that the cool temperature helped so im not sure if the weather helped or hurt overall a cloudy but dry day at a similar temperature would have been ideal sunny may have been too warmnbsp whats nextthe only thing on my race calendar is new york marathon in november i got in on time with a half marathon  another lottery bypassed thatll be my 4th world major hopefully the knee will heal up in the next month or so and ill be able to get back to real training soonnbsp picturesfull album 14

 training
a little backstory  i was a relatively average high school trackcross country runner with my best times being a 443 1600 and a 1720 5k i ran for a year in college and my best 5k there was an indoor 1703 i remember specifically during one cross country race my coach actually yelled out to me youre letting the whole team down because i was running so slow oof didnt return that year for multiple reasons

fast forward 25 years and id consider myself a washedup casual runner trying to relive glory days i never had i started taking running semiseriously again putting in sporadic 4050 mile 6480km weeks from october to december in my infinite wisdom at the start of january i jumped from 50mpw to 6066 mpw96106km and also raised the intensity somehow evading all injury probably because im young and can get away with stupid things like that i highly recommend not doing that i found a 5k at the end of january and i won it in 1627 at the end of a training week and i felt pretty good so i picked a 5k two months out as my a race with a stretch goal of running 1559 or faster for 5k

there was nothing too exciting in my training that led up to the race and i actually didnt follow any cycles of training as i understand them mostly i was just picking my workouts for the week based on how hard i thought they would be standout workouts that i did from january to march were 3x 2mile540 pace w 2min rest  800 1200 1600 1600 1200 800 all  5081559 5k pace with equal rest  8x600 5k pace 200m active recovery 8x200 3k pace 200m active recovery  which led to me forming and subsequently ripping a giant blister on the ball of my foot and sidelined me from doing anything too intense the next 2 weeks leading up to the race 


 prerace
race start was at 730am woke up at 540am spent the next 3040 minutes in the bathroom trying to make sure i wouldnt get hit with the 10minutebeforestartohshitihavetoshit feeling in my stomach got to the race a little later than i wanted to and only did a small warmup because you guessed it i was hit with the oh shit i have to shit feeling the portapotty line was probably 40 people long and the race started in 15 minutes one part of me was convincing myself that there would be enough time the other part was convincing me that it doesnt matter if i shit down my leg during a 5k as long as i win and get out of there as fast as possible fortunately i got in and out about 5 minutes before the race was set to start and went to the line conditions were fantastic very little wind and probably around 55f127c

 race
1st mile the gun went off and i led for about 800m i knew that there was the potential for there to be a couple of other runners faster than me and i heard one of them catching up to me around halfway into the first mile he made a move and i wasnt opposed to letting him lead and sitting on him slowly he was breaking away from me more and more but i knew that the first mile wasnt going to decide who wins the race  plus even if he does beat me i could at least get strung along to a good time we came through the first mile at 454 and the first thought in my head was oh so i just spent these two months of training to blow myself up in the first mile 

2nd mile surprisingly i felt pretty good after coming through the 1st mile in 454 unfortunately this is where trouble started to happen almost like the running gods wanted to deliver me some karmic justice for running the 5k in vaporfly 4s my left shoe became fully untied and most of my focus for the rest of the race went towards trying to control my pace so i can run fast enough so that my shoe stays on but i also dont slow down too much with about 800m to go from the 2nd mile marker there were some train tracks which very inconveniently had a train passing by at that exact moment the train itself didnt interfere with the race however the roadblocks came down and we had to crouchslide under it if we wanted to continue with the course i dodged the train slid under the barrier prevented my shoe from flying off and crossed the 2 mile marker in 1005

3rd milefinish at this point i just wanted to maintain first place and still finish with a decent time because i knew that my untied shoe was slowing me down by a lot i thought about kicking it off earlier into the race but the course was ran on the streets and there were some gravel sideroads so i didnt want to risk any damage to my foot which was also the still healing ripped blister foot i mentioned earlier i could feel myself slowing down and i heard the second place guy reeling me in the closer and closer i got to the finish i picked up the pace and started my kick around 300m out flashed by the 3mile marker in 1534 and rounded the corner into the final straightaway the second place guy was right behind me but all i could think about was how pissed off i am at my shoe and i kicked it off and let it fly i crossed the mat in 16067 chip time with a 16083 gun time second place was right behind me in 16085 


 postrace
stuck around for awards turns out that they didnt actually have the finisher medals for the overall winners im very pleased with the race and the time even though i didnt meet my goal of sub16 when i was so close not to make too many excuses for myself because the time is what it is but im going to tell myself that if i properly tied my shoe i might have went 155x what the important part to me though is my own personal growth as a runner and how these past couple months have really renewed my love for running the one year in college i ran was probably the worst i ever felt from running i could never hit my marks my race  times were super slow i could never meet paces in practices etc etc when i was running that cross country race and my coach shouted out at me youre letting the entire team down i felt like that was the nail in the coffin and i would never get any faster than what i was currently at jump to now and im over a minute faster in the 5k and i dropped 21 seconds in my 5k in the span of two months and i love running now more than i ever have im taking all aspects of running more seriously now still struggling at times especially sleep and nutrition i think im rambling at this point now so ill just end it here with dont let anyone or anything kill your passion whether it be for running or for anything else in life only you know what youre capable of and most of the time what youre capable of will surprise even you

 training
i used to run a lot when i was in high school but the last 34 years were very busy with looking for a job settling down etc 10 weeks ago my girlfriend almost begged me to go out for a run with her went for a 7km run and could not walk for the next two days 
i was a little angry with myself so i decided to chose a goal and train for it 
the antwerp ten miles is the biggest running event in belgium so i tried to give it a go 

 prerace
i talked with a friend about the race he told me that his goal was 1 hour and 10 minutes during my training i had a 16 km run that i did in 1hour 27 minutes so i hoped for 1u25 maybe 1u20 

 race
we started both in wave 1 and i tried to keep up with him for the first 78 km after 5 km my watch told me that i clocked a new pr for the 5k so i was kind of afraid that i was blowing myself up took it a little bit easier for the next couple of kms lost my friend at the 9 km mark 
the run has 30000 people competing and the atmosphere was wonderfull crazy to see how many people were standing at the side of the road to cheer for us at the end there was a hill where i managed to find my friend again and finish in 11450 
at first i did not believe my watch untill the app showed me the same time
so happy with the result and with the joy of running

a 3 hoursyes

tldr below apologies this turned into a bit of a long read

 background

so i started running in 2012 with the london marathon entered only when coerced by a mate over one too many beers

my first training run i remember managing about a km before collapsing in a heap on the grass and looking up at the sky thinking why am i doing this i was never a runner and when we were doing crosscountry at school on at least one occasion i had my mum pick me up and drop me nearer the finish so i wouldnt be one of the last back

i did some sporadic training for london but it was still very hard with lots of walking probably wasnt the best idea to run my first marathon with a gopro strapped to my head either especially one of the older chunkier models but it seemed like a good idea at the time as obviously it would be the only time i ever ran one i made it round just about a little shy of the 5 hour mark in 458 and collapsed in the finish funnel vowing never to do it again

as you can guess 2 days later i was thinking of doing it again since then i set myself a goal to run at least one every year seeing new places and keeping fit if i dont have something in the calendar the opposite tends to happen 

after a good few years running different marathons and and getting my times down i decided i wanted to have another go at london but you know actually run most of it this time easier said than done though as so far ive been unlucky 7 times in a row in the ballot in need of a challenge i figured the easiest way to run it again would be to train to get faster and qualify for a gfa place i did the first one for charity and dont feel comfortable asking people to sponsor me again just so i can run target set i started taking my running a bit more seriously added some track sessions more consistency and generally just having a bit more structure

feeling nicely trained in 2015 i ran berlin when the gfa qualifying time for me was 305 but missed it because of nothing other than not taking into account how much further than a marathon id be running doh i was looking at my average pace the entire race using the virtual partner on my garmin and came cruising through the brandenburg gate on a high believing i had it in the bag by a couple of minutesecstatic crossing the line fistpumping the air only to realise i had in fact ended up missing it by 35 seconds after having run a 13 mile more than expected oops

needless to say i was pretty frustrated with that  but i ran a good race felt good the whole time and finished strong so took away from it to fix my bad planning and try again another time in terms of enjoyment it was probably my favourite marathon up to this point everything just flowed lessons learned dont weave so much aim for the racing line start nearer the front and look at the actual timer once in a while

in 2016 i wanted to change it up a bit so i ran my first ultra 50mi race instead and ended up setting new prs in the 5k 1821 10k 3804 and half 12431 distances solely as a sideeffect of the training which was less intensity than id done before just more time on my feet the peak i think was 20mile30mile backtoback days over one weekend but i ran slower most of my runs were just to cover the distance the half i had planned was aimed as an upbeat training run for the ultra and i was wearing a full camelbak of water to simulate it with no intention of setting any records i also managed a 307 at the heartbreaker marathonhttpswwwheartbreakermarathoncouk which is essentially running up over and down a big hill in the new forest 7 times

i figured since i was only 2 mins off my pancakeflat marathon pr time gfa was within reach then i went travelling for a while and running was on the backburner well i ran the gold coast marathon in australia on the back of 35km of total training miles for fun as i happened to be there at the time i dont recommend this training plan for prs d

in 2018 i figured it was time in the spring i ran brighton and held onto target pace for sub 305 till the half way mark then everything went out the window and i ended up having to walk multiple times 8 in the second half i was knocked out with a chest infection for a good chunk of the training so it just didnt happen was undertrained and not fully recovered came in way out at 318

fortunately i was lucky enough to get a place in berlin again so wasnt too beat i knew i had the whole summer to recover and train and then to just aim for the same as 2015 but without the distance screwup well that and the slight added difficulty of the gfa gender parity changes bringing the qualifying time down to sub3 but i was actually not too bothered by this as it made it more of a challenge and rolled two nice goals into one gfa also meant breaking 3 hours

this time i figured id change up my training plan a bit to something a bit more serious with some more volume worked for the ultra and after lurking here for a while settled on pfitz 1855 i remember finding it amusing after getting a copy of that book that the entry level noobie plan started at 55 miles per week id run nowhere near this volume before probably more like a peak of 3035 miles so was curious as to 1 whether i could withstand it and 2 if i could physically find the time for it

before this plan i had either just done my own training adhoc or more recently the first plan which had got me my 305 pr training went super well for 9 weeks really enjoyed it and had some memorable runs including a delightful 20 miler in the sunshine on a glorious day feeling great the whole way except slight problem after that run i seemed to have developed a calf injury which pretty much stopped me running for the rest of the summer while kipchoge smashed the wr on the same course ahead of me i clocked in at 353 

was getting to the point of giving up on this sub3gfa goal for a while but thought id have one more punt at it first needed a fast flat course and having done berlin twice already was after something new rotterdam

 training

after a bad experience getting injured with pfitz 1855 in my previous training i put some thought into whether to try it again or not but other than getting injured id felt good during the training and actually found it easier to do than the first one even though it was a lot more volume it changed my mindset and i found that running just became something i was doing most days 5 out of 7 as part of my routine even though the volume was higher than i was used to it was spread out over the week into smaller chunks and i got used to just going out in morningevening and being back in the time i probably would have just wasted before

so i figured id give it another shot listen to my body more replace my shoes hydrate better and take more care of nutrition that and these subs are full of people praising pfitz so i was keen to experience it actually working

this time a few weeks after starting i was knocked out for a couple of weeks after being around some cats for too long which although super fluffy and cute are walking lungdestroyers to me due to allergies somehow i managed to still get my training in moving days around and dialling back the intensity a lot once i recovered from that i felt great for a few runs until on another i ended up slipping down a hilly country road on a muddy rock and twisting my ankle badly

somehow though one way or another i was able to complete every training run this time save a few swapped out for tuneup races total miles run in training to the day before the race was 802 a lot more than id normally do

 prerace

arrived in rotterdam on the thursday went to the expo on friday nice and chilled out at that time and basically tried to do anything to forget about the race which was hard as it would be my third attempt i really wanted to get it this time and was getting phantom painsniggles constantly went for a cycle around instead on the saturday great city saturday night plan was just to get some pasta standard and an early night with the amount of people having the same idea that meant standing up on my feet queuing for literally over 45 mins to get a meal in vapiano

i also managed to book an air bnb that had a cat not ideal every time i opened the door he was sitting right outside it looking up at me with his cute grinning face anyway managed to get a fairly good nights sleep in the end and the place was only a short walk to the start 

 race strategy

my strategy was to start a little bit behind the 3hr pacers and then gradually catch up with them over the course of the first few miles doing this i figured all i had to do then was stay with the group and id be on track with the time i spent before crossing the line after them being a small buffer this would let me not stress too much looking at my watch the whole time and remove the risk of miscalculating again all i would have to do is stay with them and it was a donedeal my assumption being the pacers would be accurate

my fueling strategy was to take one gel at the start and then carry 4 to have one every 5 miles in previous races ive taken jelly babies and had 2 every odd mile after about 10k worked for me but logistically was tricky and sticky before that i generally took no fuel at all this time though i wanted to put more thought into this side of things and found the sis gels to agree pretty well with me especially vanilla flavour mmm

it was going to be a hotter day than id like weather forecast had it starting around 14c and rising up to 1819c by the time id hopefully finish and peaking at 21c later in the afternoon because of that i decided to run with a small handheld water bottle as an emergency supply the prerace email warned of the high temperature and to adjust your goal adding to the nerves i felt like i was ready for maybe a 257258 but with the heat that small fitness buffer would hopefully just carry me in before 3 hours

 race day

woke up had my standard prerace marathon breakfast of porridge with melted dark chocolate cup of tea and a banana to save for a bit before the start tried and tested 7 times now

avoided kitty and got out for a 5 min warm up jog planned to do a second 5 minute jog but being a big city race everyone had started moving into the corrals already by this point about half past 9 with the race starting at 10 that second warm up lasted only about 30s before i hit a wall of people stationary at the start of the wave 5 corral packed in like sardines across the whole breadth of the road i realised i had to get through them to wave 1 shit

i remember thinking a recurring thought of the last couple of weeks that the marathon is much more of a beast than the half not so much because of the extra training but all the other variables that need to come together on the day when precious seconds might be all that decides whether you hit a goal just not being able to get to my start and having to begin near the back could be the end of it no matter if all the training was meticulous or getting tripped up at the start or not being able to find a prerace loo without a crazy queue all things that have happened to me before

with 10 mins to go till the start i was still picking my way slowly through the crowd trying to reach wave 1 was starting to worry i wouldnt make it in time till i saw the 3hr pacer picking his way through too and being let by more easily so i tried to stick with him worked to an extent till i got too far behind and lost him ended up just before the race as far forward as i could get but with no sign of the 3h pacer that put the race strategy out the window as i wasnt going to start trying to catch up with them if they might be minutes ahead by the time i crossed the start

 first 5km 0413 average minkm

the klaxon went off and everyone started running with me still a little stressed from the lessthanideal start and trying to just concentrate on the race trying to take in that im here this is the race youve been training for all those long dayseveningsnights youre not injured youre not ill this is it sometimes i find on long training cycles the end goal race seems so far away that by the time it comes around it takes me by surprise this was one of those

i planned to run the first mile a little slower than mp but ended up getting caught up in the other runners as always so was actually about 10s too fast and consciously told myself to slow down the road was quite narrow in many places often divided into two sections by tram tracks which made it carnage in places i had a couple of moments of almost getting tripped up when another runner decided to cross right in front of me to find a gap through again simple things that can make or break the race

drink stations are every 5k and they hand out water in a different way to how ive ever seen before they give you a cup with a discshaped foam sponge wedged in it with slits cut out the idea is that you drink through the slits in the sponge to stop it going everywhere then use the sponge to cool down after my first one was a complete failure water went everywhere except in my mouth hope the next stop is better because i can feel it getting hotter

 5km to 10km 0414 average minkm

to my welcome surprise i came up on the 3hr pace group id been running a little faster than mp so it made sense at some point but thought theyd have started a long time before me

i hung toward the back and was enjoying running in more of a pack as normally i just go it alone or try to pick someone who looks of similar pace and hang with them for a while but at the 10k water stop it was complete carnage there were so many people crisscrossing infront of me that the trip hazard increased exponentially at that point i decided to move to the front of the group to get some more space

 10km to 15km 0412 average minkm

im feeling pretty good but am getting really distracted by the two dutch pacers who are chatting to each other the whole time theyre clearly fitenough that the pace is casual but for some reason this stresses me out as im conscious of the fact that im running well and feel okay but that could quickly change so i decide to move slightly upfield just to get out of earshot not behind as i dont want to get stuck in the pack again

ive joined a few others who have also split off from the group and run with them and by this point ive finally got the hang of the water cups the sponge system actually works really well and im able to drink the whole cup while only mildly slowing my pace

my first gel goes in tropical flavour i dont feel like i need it at all so it feels like its good timing to take it

 15km to 20km 0412 average minkm

im running strong and am consistently hitting splits just below where i need to be to actually know what those splits were though needed a bit of setup

see my mind does everything in miles i know what different paces feel like and it all makes sense kilometers on the other hand are completely alien to me and mean absolutely nothing a 650 mile is one thing but a 414km wtf is that

i asked at the expo whether the distance markers would be in km or miles and the answer was km only which completely makes sense but i knew would throw me off a bit fortunately i stumbled across race screenhttpsappsgarmincomengbapps6a30651bca6741a596dc60634983fc93 which is a data field you can add to a garmin running watch i left my watch in miles mode but set this up to use kms then turn off autolap and instead each time i pass a km marker i manually trigger a lap and the field calculates everything for me including resetting the distance ive actually travelled to take into account driftgps error and giving me an updated predicted time worked great highly recommend it

 20km to 25km 0411 average minkm

i cross through half way in 12854 pretty much exactly where i wanted to be doing a quick body check everything is ok and i am enjoying the extra running space that had opened up by now it was much easier to just get in the zone and keep running knowing psychologically that every step now is making the distance remaining even less than ive already covered was a boost though strangely its had the opposite effect before

its getting a lot warmer though and theres sponge stops inbetween water stops im taking them every time and trying to keep my face cool but the lack of any kind of shade or cover is a concern as im aware that its only going to get hotter

my legs are feeling ok at the moment and am happy that the phantom pains i was having around my left kneecap dont seem to have revealed their ghoulish selves

at 15 miles gel number 3 goes in id settled on 2x tropical 2x vanilla to get me through thinking about the next one every 5 miles has been giving me a little minigoal to work towards and its satisfying to think of shedding the albeit tiny extra weight and supplies as i get through each one

 25km to 30km 0411 average minkm

another solid 5k ticked off staying below pace the whole time race screen has been updating my predictions in realtime to somewhere in the 257258 band which im happy about as the thought that there is a small buffer there in case i start to fade is motivating

my mind still doesnt let me get complacent though and i actually find that i dont want to keep looking at my watch the constantly changing numbers start to stress me out a little with all the little fluctuations in my pace making bigger fluctuations in my expected finish time instead i flick it over to hr for a while see that im running pretty much bang in the right zone and leave it there not looking at it

instead im enjoying the kms ticking by one side effect of not working in kms is that they seem to come by much faster than im expecting before i know it im coming across another at some points i dont even notice passing one and come up on the next expecting to have covered 1km but its actually 2 sweet im concsious though that i dont want to get ahead of myself and know that my pace has drifted a little faster than the goal im hyperfocussed on not wanting to burn out but am playing the value of staying ahead of the big pace group vs slowing the pace a little as im not looking at my watch much im just running naturally and just keep doing that but knowing that if anything you could slow down a tad which is much more appealing to me than you were behind on that last split pick it up

 30km to 35km 0413 average minkm

still maintaining pace but starting to feel it drag on and the mind has fleeting thoughts about the distance still to come but thankfully because of all the evening runs ive put it in training i just tell myself pftt only a 10km to go till the final checkpoint and the last kick to the finish 10km is nothing you cover that on a weeknight for a jolly before dinner

but my resolve is starting to be tested i can tell

 35km to 40km 0422 average minkm

passing through the 30km mark you can see the 40km right next to it but on the other side of the road ouch im looking at it longingly wishing i was there already with only that last 2km kick to go but knowing i have 10k to go before that yet the elites start to come by on the other side too which oddly i dont find encouraging just keep thinking i want to be there right now

at this point im starting to break down mentally its really hot now and im having thoughts along the lines of why do i even want to do this again and why not just stop now and walk for a bit these kind of thoughts have been my downfall before so my usual approach now is just to train harder to make the raceday itself feel less hard that probably makes no sense and is the opposite of most people letting the adrenaline of the race make it all come together for some reason though i find it much easier to push harder in training than on the day itself when i hit a rough patch in the actual race after im already going hard and know that i cant pullback thats tough i prefer to race slightly under the threshold so if anything i end up slightly too fast and having to make myself hang back then sprint finish the end strong this probably means i dont test my full potential sometimes but i dont mind that so much as when i finish with a bit of energy left im thinking cool could have gone faster and then the next time i aim to do that versus that was literally flatout intensity thats the limit of my ability

not so today though the heat has just made it hard generally d i make the decision that im probably getting nowhere near enough water even after mastering the sponge cup im super thirsty salivating for water and decide i need at least two so opt to walk through the 35k water stop and just get as much as i can as soon as ive cleared the stop again i get back running ive spent some seconds taking in fluid but i feel like it was a wellcalculated cost

then kms 3739 drag on forever at 38 i cant believe its not 40 yet as im conscious that im slowing down ive slipped behind mp but not by too much and from moving ahead of the pacers at the beginning i know i have a bit of a buffer to fall into but im paranoid about them passing back by me as has happened to be before and leaving me dejected so i keep pushing on as best i can

 40km to finish 0451 average minkm

finally i hit the 40k mark and walk through the stop guzzling as much cool water as possible again just 2km to go now

my pace really slows down again over the last 2k to well below mp the pace group is still behind me though so my concentration turns to just trying to dig deep and keep moving it doesnt help that at this point the guy running just in front of me drops something maybe his phone and keeps going for a few metres before realising and stopping instantaneously and turning round to go back and pick it up naturally this makes me run straight into him which throws me off a bit hold it together

im so close now i can feel it i remember telling my gf that it wouldnt be till 40km that i can relax and be pretty confident that ill make it well im at 40km and i have no idea if ill make it

i get to see her just after 41km for the 6th time thats a marathon in itself and shes shouting encouragement at me which is great manage a smile as i turn the corner that last km just kept going and i remember thinking how surreal it is to not even notice a km in a training run or earlier in the race but now what at one time is benevolent is a beast

turning another corner i finally came in sight of the finish there it is third attempt at the goal several years back and forth to get there and here i am at this point on the cusp of success or failure i can see the clock taunting me with its big red numbers slowly ticking down to 3hrs i must be only about 50m away as i see it finally tick over and start counting up the other side 30001 30002 i can see it i want to sprint to it but i cant im slowly moving towards it but it doesnt seem to be getting much closer

other people are passing me who look like theyre running im in a daze and not really noticing anything other than the numbers and feebly attempting to coerce my legs into carrying me towards them

30006 30007

how much buffer do i have cant check watch now just f run cant run going at full speed legs not cooperating

30013 30014

is it a mirage whos moving the line

and then finally i make it over

30016

is what the clock reads as i pass under is it enough i have no idea at this point and then i remember to check the elapsed time on my watch again for the first time this race 25941 yeahhhh

walking through the finish area im in a bit of a daze and sapped of all energy so walking is very generous but am elated

 post race

i take my medal walk out the finish area and lie down on the grass in the sunshine for the first time today im enjoying the sun beating down on me at this point i also realise my emergency water bottle is still completely full ive just been carrying it around the whole race and not using it at all despite dying of thirst around 35km oops guess thats part of the nature of this beast the mind does some funny things

 whats next

realised in the days after the race that i felt so calm and content like a big weight had been lifted off my shoulders ive had this race at the back of my mind for a long time and am enjoying being on the other side looking forward to finding some new challenge to work towards

its great to have a goal but sometimes its too easy to forget what the point is and to just blindly keep pursuing it im sure i fell into that trap at some point but now i remember why i wanted to push myself to achieve it to open up new challenges and to push the boundaries of what i can accomplish by slowly chipping away at it until that next challenge whether running related or not that seemed so insurmountable before now becomes within reach if you want it enough

when i ran my first marathon in 2012 it took me almost 5 hours before that i didnt run at all and would just spectate london and think it must be great to be able to run a marathon i wish i can do that one day now i can say im a sub 3 runner

whats next hopefully fingers crossed will have a gfa place for london 2020 but for now looking forward to dialing it back a bit maybe ill try for a faster 5k10k instead maybe ill just have some time off running for a while to rekindle the desire

a chest infection for a good chunk of the training so it just didnt happen was undertrained and not fully recovered came in way out at 318fortunately i was lucky enough to get a place in berlin again so wasnt too beat i knew i had the whole summer to recover and train and then to just aim for the same as 2015 but without the distance screwup well that and the slight added difficulty of the gfa gender parity changes bringing the qualifying time down to sub3 but i was actually not too bothered by this as it made it more of a challenge and rolled two nice goals into one gfa also meant breaking 3 hoursthis time i figured id change up my training plan a bit to something a bit more serious with some more volume worked for the ultra and after lurking here for a while settled on pfitz 1855 i remember finding it amusing after getting a copy of that book that the entry level noobie plan started at 55 miles per week id run nowhere near this volume before probably more like a peak of 3035 miles so was curious as to 1 whether i could withstand it and 2 if i could physically find the time for itbefore this plan i had either just done my own training adhoc or more recently the first plan which had got me my 305 pr training went super well for 9 weeks really enjoyed it and had some memorable runs including a delightful 20 miler in the sunshine on a glorious day feeling great the whole way except slight problem after that run i seemed to have developed a calf injury which pretty much stopped me running for the rest of the summer while kipchoge smashed the wr on the same course ahead of me i clocked in at 353 was getting to the point of giving up on this sub3gfa goal for a while but thought id have one more punt at it first needed a fast flat course and having done berlin twice already was after something new rotterdam trainingafter a bad experience getting injured with pfitz 1855 in my previous training i put some thought into whether to try it again or not but other than getting injured id felt good during the training and actually found it easier to do than the first one even though it was a lot more volume it changed my mindset and i found that running just became something i was doing most days 5 out of 7 as part of my routine even though the volume was higher than i was used to it was spread out over the week into smaller chunks and i got used to just going out in morningevening and being back in the time i probably would have just wasted beforeso i figured id give it another shot listen to my body more replace my shoes hydrate better and take more care of nutrition that and these subs are full of people praising pfitz so i was keen to experience it actually workingthis time a few weeks after starting i was knocked out for a couple of weeks after being around some cats for too long which although super fluffy and cute are walking lungdestroyers to me due to allergies somehow i managed to still get my training in moving days around and dialling back the intensity a lot once i recovered from that i felt great for a few runs until on another i ended up slipping down a hilly country road on a muddy rock and twisting my ankle badlysomehow though one way or another i was able to complete every training run this time save a few swapped out for tuneup races total miles run in training to the day before the race was 802 a lot more than id normally do preracearrived in rotterdam on the thursday went to the expo on friday nice and chilled out at that time and basically tried to do anything to forget about the race which was hard as it would be my third attempt i really wanted to get it this time and was getting phantom painsniggles constantly went for a cycle around instead on the saturday great city saturday night plan was just to get some pasta standard and an early night with the amount of people having the same idea that meant standing up on my feet queuing for literally over 45 mins to get a meal in vapianoi also managed to book an air bnb that had a cat not ideal every time i opened the door he was sitting right outside it looking up at me with his cute grinning face anyway managed to get a fairly good nights sleep in the end and the place was only a short walk to the start  race strategymy strategy was to start a little bit behind the 3hr pacers and then gradually catch up with them over the course of the first few miles doing this i figured all i had to do then was stay with the group and id be on track with the time i spent before crossing the line after them being a small buffer this would let me not stress too much looking at my watch the whole time and remove the risk of miscalculating again all i would have to do is stay with them and it was a donedeal my assumption being the pacers would be accuratemy fueling strategy was to take one gel at the start and then carry 4 to have one every 5 miles in previous races ive taken jelly babies and had 2 every odd mile after about 10k worked for me but logistically was tricky and sticky before that i generally took no fuel at all this time though i wanted to put more thought into this side of things and found the sis gels to agree pretty well with me especially vanilla flavour mmmit was going to be a hotter day than id like weather forecast had it starting around 14c and rising up to 1819c by the time id hopefully finish and peaking at 21c later in the afternoon because of that i decided to run with a small handheld water bottle as an emergency supply the prerace email warned of the high temperature and to adjust your goal adding to the nerves i felt like i was ready for maybe a 257258 but with the heat that small fitness buffer would hopefully just carry me in before 3 hours race daywoke up had my standard prerace marathon breakfast of porridge with melted dark chocolate cup of tea and a banana to save for a bit before the start tried and tested 7 times nowavoided kitty and got out for a 5 min warm up jog planned to do a second 5 minute jog but being a big city race everyone had started moving into the corrals already by this point about half past 9 with the race starting at 10 that second warm up lasted only about 30s before i hit a wall of people stationary at the start of the wave 5 corral packed in like sardines across the whole breadth of the road i realised i had to get through them to wave 1 shiti remember thinking a recurring thought of the last couple of weeks that the marathon is much more of a beast than the half not so much because of the extra training but all the other variables that need to come together on the day when precious seconds might be all that decides whether you hit a goal just not being able to get to my start and having to begin near the back could be the end of it no matter if all the training was meticulous or getting tripped up at the start or not being able to find a prerace loo without a crazy queue all things that have happened to me beforewith 10 mins to go till the start i was still picking my way slowly through the crowd trying to reach wave 1 was starting to worry i wouldnt make it in time till i saw the 3hr pacer picking his way through too and being let by more easily so i tried to stick with him worked to an extent till i got too far behind and lost him ended up just before the race as far forward as i could get but with no sign of the 3h pacer that put the race strategy out the window as i wasnt going to start trying to catch up with them if they might be minutes ahead by the time i crossed the start first 5km 0413 average minkmthe klaxon went off and everyone started running with me still a little stressed from the lessthanideal start and trying to just concentrate on the race trying to take in that im here this is the race youve been training for all those long dayseveningsnights youre not injured youre not ill this is it sometimes i find on long training cycles the end goal race seems so far away that by the time it comes around it takes me by surprise this was one of thosei planned to run the first mile a little slower than mp but ended up getting caught up in the other runners as always so was actually about 10s too fast and consciously told myself to slow down the road was quite narrow in many places often divided into two sections by tram tracks which made it carnage in places i had a couple of moments of almost getting tripped up when another runner decided to cross right in front of me to find a gap through again simple things that can make or break the racedrink stations are every 5k and they hand out water in a different way to how ive ever seen before they give you a cup with a discshaped foam sponge wedged in it with slits cut out the idea is that you drink through the slits in the sponge to stop it going everywhere then use the sponge to cool down after my first one was a complete failure water went everywhere except in my mouth hope the next stop is better because i can feel it getting hotter 5km to 10km 0414 average minkmto my welcome surprise i came up on the 3hr pace group id been running a little faster than mp so it made sense at some point but thought theyd have started a long time before mei hung toward the back and was enjoying running in more of a pack as normally i just go it alone or try to pick someone who looks of similar pace and hang with them for a while but at the 10k water stop it was complete carnage there were so many people crisscrossing infront of me that the trip hazard increased exponentially at that point i decided to move to the front of the group to get some more space 10km to 15km 0412 average minkmim feeling pretty good but am getting really distracted by the two dutch pacers who are chatting to each other the whole time theyre clearly fitenough that the pace is casual but for some reason this stresses me out as im conscious of the fact that im running well and feel okay but that could quickly change so i decide to move slightly upfield just to get out of earshot not behind as i dont want to get stuck in the pack againive joined a few others who have also split off from the group and run with them and by this point ive finally got the hang of the water cups the sponge system actually works really well and im able to drink the whole cup while only mildly slowing my pacemy first gel goes in tropical flavour i dont feel like i need it at all so it feels like its good timing to take it 15km to 20km 0412 average minkmim running strong and am consistently hitting splits just below where i need to be to actually know what those splits were though needed a bit of setupsee my mind does everything in miles i know what different paces feel like and it all makes sense kilometers on the other hand are completely alien to me and mean absolutely nothing a 650 mile is one thing but a 414km wtf is thati asked at the expo whether the distance markers would be in km or miles and the answer was km only which completely makes sense but i knew would throw me off a bit fortunately i stumbled across race screenhttpsappsgarmincomengbapps6a30651bca6741a596dc60634983fc93 which is a data field you can add to a garmin running watch i left my watch in miles mode but set this up to use kms then turn off autolap and instead each time i pass a km marker i manually trigger a lap and the field calculates everything for me including resetting the distance ive actually travelled to take into account driftgps error and giving me an updated predicted time worked great highly recommend it 20km to 25km 0411 average minkmi cross through half way in 12854 pretty much exactly where i wanted to be doing a quick body check everything is ok and i am enjoying the extra running space that had opened up by now it was much easier to just get in the zone and keep running knowing psychologically that every step now is making the distance remaining even less than ive already covered was a boost though strangely its had the opposite effect beforeits getting a lot warmer though and theres sponge stops inbetween water stops im taking them every time and trying to keep my face cool but the lack of any kind of shade or cover is a concern as im aware that its only going to get hottermy legs are feeling ok at the moment and am happy that the phantom pains i was having around my left kneecap dont seem to have revealed their ghoulish selvesat 15 miles gel number 3 goes in id settled on 2x tropical 2x vanilla to get me through thinking about the next one every 5 miles has been giving me a little minigoal to work towards and its satisfying to think of shedding the albeit tiny extra weight and supplies as i get through each one 25km to 30km 0411 average minkmanother solid 5k ticked off staying below pace the whole time race screen has been updating my predictions in realtime to somewhere in the 257258 band which im happy about as the thought that there is a small buffer there in case i start to fade is motivatingmy mind still doesnt let me get complacent though and i actually find that i dont want to keep looking at my watch the constantly changing numbers start to stress me out a little with all the little fluctuations in my pace making bigger fluctuations in my expected finish time instead i flick it over to hr for a while see that im running pretty much bang in the right zone and leave it there not looking at itinstead im enjoying the kms ticking by one side effect of not working in kms is that they seem to come by much faster than im expecting before i know it im coming across another at some points i dont even notice passing one and come up on the next expecting to have covered 1km but its actually 2 sweet im concsious though that i dont want to get ahead of myself and know that my pace has drifted a little faster than the goal im hyperfocussed on not wanting to burn out but am playing the value of staying ahead of the big pace group vs slowing the pace a little as im not looking at my watch much im just running naturally and just keep doing that but knowing that if anything you could slow down a tad which is much more appealing to me than you were behind on that last split pick it up 30km to 35km 0413 average minkmstill maintaining pace but starting to feel it drag on and the mind has fleeting thoughts about the distance still to come but thankfully because of all the evening runs ive put it in training i just tell myself pftt only a 10km to go till the final checkpoint and the last kick to the finish 10km is nothing you cover that on a weeknight for a jolly before dinnerbut my resolve is starting to be tested i can tell 35km to 40km 0422 average minkmpassing through the 30km mark you can see the 40km right next to it but on the other side of the road ouch im looking at it longingly wishing i was there already with only that last 2km kick to go but knowing i have 10k to go before that yet the elites start to come by on the other side too which oddly i dont find encouraging just keep thinking i want to be there right nowat this point im starting to break down mentally its really hot now and im having thoughts along the lines of why do i even want to do this again and why not just stop now and walk for a bit these kind of thoughts have been my downfall before so my usual approach now is just to train harder to make the raceday itself feel less hard that probably makes no sense and is the opposite of most people letting the adrenaline of the race make it all come together for some reason though i find it much easier to push harder in training than on the day itself when i hit a rough patch in the actual race after im already going hard and know that i cant pullback thats tough i prefer to race slightly under the threshold so if anything i end up slightly too fast and having to make myself hang back then sprint finish the end strong this probably means i dont test my full potential sometimes but i dont mind that so much as when i finish with a bit of energy left im thinking cool could have gone faster and then the next time i aim to do that versus that was literally flatout intensity thats the limit of my abilitynot so today though the heat has just made it hard generally d i make the decision that im probably getting nowhere near enough water even after mastering the sponge cup im super thirsty salivating for water and decide i need at least two so opt to walk through the 35k water stop and just get as much as i can as soon as ive cleared the stop again i get back running ive spent some seconds taking in fluid but i feel like it was a wellcalculated costthen kms 3739 drag on forever at 38 i cant believe its not 40 yet as im conscious that im slowing down ive slipped behind mp but not by too much and from moving ahead of the pacers at the beginning i know i have a bit of a buffer to fall into but im paranoid about them passing back by me as has happened to be before and leaving me dejected so i keep pushing on as best i can 40km to finish 0451 average minkmfinally i hit the 40k mark and walk through the stop guzzling as much cool water as possible again just 2km to go nowmy pace really slows down again over the last 2k to well below mp the pace group is still behind me though so my concentration turns to just trying to dig deep and keep moving it doesnt help that at this point the guy running just in front of me drops something maybe his phone and keeps going for a few metres before realising and stopping instantaneously and turning round to go back and pick it up naturally this makes me run straight into him which throws me off a bit hold it togetherim so close now i can feel it i remember telling my gf that it wouldnt be till 40km that i can relax and be pretty confident that ill make it well im at 40km and i have no idea if ill make iti get to see her just after 41km for the 6th time thats a marathon in itself and shes shouting encouragement at me which is great manage a smile as i turn the corner that last km just kept going and i remember thinking how surreal it is to not even notice a km in a training run or earlier in the race but now what at one time is benevolent is a beastturning another corner i finally came in sight of the finish there it is third attempt at the goal several years back and forth to get there and here i am at this point on the cusp of success or failure i can see the clock taunting me with its big red numbers slowly ticking down to 3hrs i must be only about 50m away as i see it finally tick over and start counting up the other side 30001 30002 i can see it i want to sprint to it but i cant im slowly moving towards it but it doesnt seem to be getting much closerother people are passing me who look like theyre running im in a daze and not really noticing anything other than the numbers and feebly attempting to coerce my legs into carrying me towards them30006 30007how much buffer do i have cant check watch now just f run cant run going at full speed legs not cooperating30013 30014is it a mirage whos moving the lineand then finally i make it over30016is what the clock reads as i pass under is it enough i have no idea at this point and then i remember to check the elapsed time on my watch again for the first time this race 25941 yeahhhhwalking through the finish area im in a bit of a daze and sapped of all energy so walking is very generous but am elated post racei take my medal walk out the finish area and lie down on the grass in the sunshine for the first time today im enjoying the sun beating down on me at this point i also realise my emergency water bottle is still completely full ive just been carrying it around the whole race and not using it at all despite dying of thirst around 35km oops guess thats part of the nature of this beast the mind does some funny things whats nextrealised in the days after the race that i felt so calm and content like a big weight had been lifted off my shoulders ive had this race at the back of my mind for a long time and am enjoying being on the other side looking forward to finding some new challenge to work towardsits great to have a goal but sometimes its too easy to forget what the point is and to just blindly keep pursuing it im sure i fell into that trap at some point but now i remember why i wanted to push myself to achieve it to open up new challenges and to push the boundaries of what i can accomplish by slowly chipping away at it until that next challenge whether running related or not that seemed so insurmountable before now becomes within reach if you want it enoughwhen i ran my first marathon in 2012 it took me almost 5 hours before that i didnt run at all and would just spectate london and think it must be great to be able to run a marathon i wish i can do that one day now i can say im a sub 3 runnerwhats next hopefully fingers crossed will have a gfa place for london 2020 but for now looking forward to dialing it back a bit maybe ill try for a faster 5k10k instead maybe ill just have some time off running for a while to rekindle the desire

 training


between 20 and 40km per week since last august and a bunch of cycling most weeks would be parkrun on saturday a 4km handicap run at lunchtime with work colleagues a bunch of cycling workouts with a lot of hill climbing to train for the peaks challenge falls creek httpswwwbicyclenetworkcomauridesandeventspeakschallenge which was on march 10 all up runningcycling would usually be between 10 and 12 hours per week generally with a ratio of 21 or 31 cyclingrunning

longer runs have been a problem for me since i am quite injury prone in the month leading up to the half i did three of the longest runs ive ever done and then the half which was the longest

a brief history of my athletic career would be started in 2013 ran some halfassed races in 2013 and 2014 took a break to focus on halfassed cycling in 2015 and 2016 did basically nothing in 2017 started from scratch in january 2018 injured myself and was out of the game for four months and started mostly from scratch in august 

prior to 2013 i was basically a very overweight couch potato

 race strategy

i had no idea how fast id be able to run the half but my parkrun pb leading up to this was 1925 and i used daniels vdot calculator to extrapolate a time for my half which was around 127 i wasnt confident id be able to do this since id never tried to hold a pace for longer than about 40 minutes so i settled on a more achievable goal of 90 minutes 416km pace 

somewhere between two and zero weeks out i decided that if i tapered properly and laid off the bike for a few days which i had never done prior to this  there would typically always be a hard bike workout leading into my hard run workoutsraces i would be able to run quicker so i took another look at the vdot calculation and settled on a 128 stretch goal which was about 410 pace 

my final strategy was to start at about 410412 and then see how that felt after a few kilometres and speed up if possible

 prerace

i ate far too much on the saturday perhaps getting a little excited with the carb loading which i had intended to be an extra meal or two anyway i woke up in the night at about 4am ate an energy bar and then drank some gatorade in the car on the way to the race and resolved not to consume anything on the run itself due to some bad experiences id had recently while eating gels during my long runs i went to the toilet before the start and didnt suffer any gi issues on the run which was nice

 race

the race itself went really well i went out at 411 409 412 for the first three km splits and they felt super easy almost like i was floating this really helped ease my apprehensions about not being able to run a good race and i was feeling really good for the next 1015km of the race i sped up ever so slightly towards the middle of the race recording a 403 for the 8th kilometre

from there i just focused on holding steady until the wheels fell off which i knew they would do at some point from my experience with longer runs in the past sure enough at around the 17th or 18th split my hips and calves started to seize up and it got really hard to keep the pace under 410 the 19th split had the most elevation of any in the race or felt like it and it was my slowest at 417 but with 2 kilometres to go i knew that i had less than 9 minutes of pain left so i just pushed myself to the limit and urged myself on to the line

in the end the last 1100m of the race were on a flat level surface by the side of the river which made it easy to focus on recording a solid final split there was a guy in front of me who was running ever so slightly slower than i was which was a nice carrot to encourage me to keep pushing in the end i just passed him and recorded my quickest split as my last of 400 flat

i picked up a calf strain somewhere along the way and as i write this i am still not 100 ready to run again but cycling is not a problem and i am heading up to the mountains again over easter to ride my bike which is always nice",62,0.92,mkipp271,Race Report: First Half Marathon,21100.0,,  race information what geelong half marathon when april 14 2019 where geelong victoria australia how far 211 kilometres time 12655 strava link httpswwwstravacomactivities2287829206 website httpwwwgcccasnauindexphpgeelonghalfmarathon goals goal  description  completed  a  128  yes  b  130  yes  c  even splits  yes  negative split by 1 second  splits kilometre  time  1  410  2  409  3  412  4  408  5  408  6  407  7  405  8  403  9  407  10  409  11  406  12  412  13  405  14  409  15  403  16  408  17  411  18  410  19  417  20  407  21  400  trainingbetween 20 and 40km per week since last august and a bunch of cycling most weeks would be parkrun on saturday a 4km handicap run at lunchtime with work colleagues a bunch of cycling workouts with a lot of hill climbing to train for the peaks challenge falls creek httpswwwbicyclenetworkcomauridesandeventspeakschallenge which was on march 10 all up runningcycling would usually be between 10 and 12 hours per week generally with a ratio of 21 or 31 cyclingrunninglonger runs have been a problem for me since i am quite injury prone in the month leading up to the half i did three of the longest runs ive ever done and then the half which was the longesta brief history of my athletic career would be started in 2013 ran some halfassed races in 2013 and 2014 took a break to focus on halfassed cycling in 2015 and 2016 did basically nothing in 2017 started from scratch in january 2018 injured myself and was out of the game for four months and started mostly from scratch in august prior to 2013 i was basically a very overweight couch potato race strategyi had no idea how fast id be able to run the half but my parkrun pb leading up to this was 1925 and i used daniels vdot calculator to extrapolate a time for my half which was around 127 i wasnt confident id be able to do this since id never tried to hold a pace for longer than about 40 minutes so i settled on a more achievable goal of 90 minutes 416km pace somewhere between two and zero weeks out i decided that if i tapered properly and laid off the bike for a few days which i had never done prior to this  there would typically always be a hard bike workout leading into my hard run workoutsraces i would be able to run quicker so i took another look at the vdot calculation and settled on a 128 stretch goal which was about 410 pace my final strategy was to start at about 410412 and then see how that felt after a few kilometres and speed up if possible preracei ate far too much on the saturday perhaps getting a little excited with the carb loading which i had intended to be an extra meal or two anyway i woke up in the night at about 4am ate an energy bar and then drank some gatorade in the car on the way to the race and resolved not to consume anything on the run itself due to some bad experiences id had recently while eating gels during my long runs i went to the toilet before the start and didnt suffer any gi issues on the run which was nice racethe race itself went really well i went out at 411 409 412 for the first three km splits and they felt super easy almost like i was floating this really helped ease my apprehensions about not being able to run a good race and i was feeling really good for the next 1015km of the race i sped up ever so slightly towards the middle of the race recording a 403 for the 8th kilometrefrom there i just focused on holding steady until the wheels fell off which i knew they would do at some point from my experience with longer runs in the past sure enough at around the 17th or 18th split my hips and calves started to seize up and it got really hard to keep the pace under 410 the 19th split had the most elevation of any in the race or felt like it and it was my slowest at 417 but with 2 kilometres to go i knew that i had less than 9 minutes of pain left so i just pushed myself to the limit and urged myself on to the linein the end the last 1100m of the race were on a flat level surface by the side of the river which made it easy to focus on recording a solid final split there was a guy in front of me who was running ever so slightly slower than i was which was a nice carrot to encourage me to keep pushing in the end i just passed him and recorded my quickest split as my last of 400 flati picked up a calf strain somewhere along the way and as i write this i am still not 100 ready to run again but cycling is not a problem and i am heading up to the mountains again over easter to ride my bike which is always nice

so i have always kind of wanted to run a marathon did my first half marathon over a year ago  one day i was listening to david goggins you cant hurt me and he gave some good advice about not waiting forever to go do something so i ended up signing up for my first marathon  unfortunately i probably did not give myself enough training time  i signed up mid january and the race was in late april  i had been running 5 miles 23 times a week before that  for training i would only run 23 times per week with a long run every other weekend  definitely not the strategy i would recommend but i needed more recovery time after all my long runs likely because i was ramping it up quicker than i shouldve  i also realized i needed to start using gu on my long runs after my 17 miler  gu was a real game changer and i had a long run of 20 and 21 miles before the race with a pace right around 945 per mile which would put me under my main 430 goal and i also ran the entire time for the 21 mile run  however i did not have any taper runs following my long runs and i think that really hurt me

race strategy

really not a lot of thought went into this  i wanted to use a gu about every 5 miles and 34 miles near the end of the race  i also planned on taking the water around that time too to wash down the gu

prerace

the race was on a sunday and i stayed up until like 6am on friday  this turned out to be a blessing in disguise because i managed to go to bed around 8pm and get a good nights rest on saturday  i didnt focus too much on nutrition or a pre race meal but i tried to eat more carbs than usual  also in effort to avoid having to go to the bathroom during the race i drank a bunch of water throughout the day and night  this came back to bite me

race

the conditions were perfect weather wise  i had to pee a lot that morning and right when the race started i had to go again  i stopped for a second at around mile 3 but the bathroom line wasnt moving quickly enough  luckily at the around 4 or 5 i found a quick line and got that out of the way  i started taking the gu around mile 4 and i soon realized my phones mileage was off from the race mileage which was really annoying  despite having never ran the course i was feeling really good those first 15 miles  it was an awesome feeling seeing the half marathoners peel off and the course becomes so much less crowded  around 17 is when things started to get really hard  around 19 or 20 i had started walking for about 15 miles and then running the other 85  i stopped listening to music because music gets boring after around 35 hours  i got a little discouraged when looking at the race clock and doing some calculations in my head that i wouldnt meet my goal of 430  for some reason i didnt think that i started 15 minutes later than the first group and my goal was still probably achievable  all race numbers were confusing at this point because my phone was off by over a half mile from the actual course  i eventually saw the 430 pacer pass me which was disheartening  i kind of fell into this same group of people who were runningwalking the rest of the race and one girl who had a slower pace than the rest of us but much to her credit she never walked the entire race  my knee was really starting to hurt at this point and starting to run again always resulted in limping but i pressed onward  i put the music back on and had 3 gus between miles 1823  i wanted to run the last mile all the way but i just didnt have the energy  however as soon as i saw the finish line i started picking up the pace and pretty much sprinted by all the walkrun group of people i was going with at the very end  im proud to say that in the very end i finished strong

postrace

i drank lots of water and powerade  i was very sore while walking and my knee was aching  i was really grateful my achilles felt fine because they were slightly bothering me after my long run of 21 miles and i was worried they would be my downfall during the race  now that i am a week recovered my body feels pretty much fine again  i may not have accomplished any of my goals but i am very proud of myself for finishing the marathon

what’s next

i am about to start running again tomorrow  i am tempted to try again to better my time while i am really proud of myself for doing it i left a lot on the table    also i love those long runs in the

unfortunately i probably did not give myself enough training time  i signed up mid january and the race was in late april  i had been running 5 miles 23 times a week before that  for training i would only run 23 times per week with a long run every other weekend  definitely not the strategy i would recommend but i needed more recovery time after all my long runs likely because i was ramping it up quicker than i shouldve  i also realized i needed to start using gu on my long runs after my 17 miler  gu was a real game changer and i had a long run of 20 and 21 miles before the race with a pace right around 945 per mile which would put me under my main 430 goal and i also ran the entire time for the 21 mile run  however i did not have any taper runs following my long runs and i think that

started taking the gu around mile 4 and i soon realized my phones mileage was off from the race mileage which was really annoying  despite having never ran the course i was feeling really good those

started walking for about 15 miles and then running the other 85  i stopped listening to music because music gets boring after around 35 hours  i got a little discouraged when looking at the race clock and doing some calculations in my head that i wouldnt meet my goal of 430  for some reason i didnt think that i started 15 minutes later than the first group and my goal was still probably achievable  all race numbers were confusing at this point because my phone was off by over a half mile from the actual course  i eventually saw the 430 pacer pass me which was disheartening  i kind of fell into this same group of people who were runningwalking the rest of the race and one girl who had a slower pace than the rest of us but much to her credit she never walked the entire race  my knee was really starting to hurt at this point and starting to run again always resulted in limping but i pressed onward  i put the music back on and had 3 gus between miles 1823  i wanted to run the last

i had no idea really just get out there and go with the flow 

 training

my friend sent me a link to this race 3 months ago thinking id do the trail half but the masochistic part of me thought itd be a good idea to sign up for my first 50k with no knowledge or research whatsoever boi was i naive or what i do absolutely zero training on trails so even the high volume of running ive been doing this year could have prepared me for slop that was eagerly awaiting me out on the trails i have spent the year training for a sub 125 half accomplished in march 12457 with the ultimate goal of a bq in november this was a sidetrek that i should have taken more seriously i have so much more respect for ultratrail runners now

 prerace

i couldnt fall asleep so i read deathly hallows until i fell asleep until midnight i wish i had the resurrection stone for my race so once my body died on me i could have resurrected a second life woke up at 4am had my cold brew banana and peanut butter bagel per usual watched some running youtube vids got my stuff together and was out the door by 515am with terribly wonderful trap rap blasting in my headphones once we got to the finish line we were greeted by the ultramarathon man himself dean karnanes whom i could not keep my eyes off his calves with veins pulsating with unicorn blood those things looked so hard they could cut diamond i dont think i heard a thing he said i was captivated the race director then gave a spiel about how secret service along the course because we could see two vips trump  the japanese prime minister shinzo abe at first i was hoping they would actually be running because i would love to see trump run nothing political the image of this would just be hilarious considering what he has said about exercise but we would end up running along the trump national golf course and away we go

 race

so many takeaways from this race first off i was way too cocky and got off to way too fast of a start the first couple of miles are actually on a wellmaintained trail so i was near the front of the group running at a 730mile pace thinking life is grand and how i could bank time now before i inevitably bonk on the hills on the backend

real life slapped some humility into me once we reached the potomac heritage trail this was a whole new world to me it was miserable it was chaotic it was miserable it was a beautiful mess that i ended up loving it had stormed the night before so the trails which are primarily only maintained by footsteps were straight slop  roots i have never run in anything close to this in my life before so i slowed the pace down and settled in with these 2 runners really until mile 10 this is when i started to realize another beauty of ultras the camaraderie everyone is so friendly from sparking up conversation with runners because you can actually breath while running to the courteous volunteers at the aid stations i was uplifted every time i passed someone as they offered words of encouragement

by mile 131 i had rolled by ankle 4 times on roots  it was hurting pretty badly i was relieved to be greeted by my friends awaiting me at the great falls aid station their hugs were like a mushroom powerup as i went into the great falls portion with a clear mindset ready to take on some hills we had what seemed to be a nice nonstop gradual hill leading up to the mile 16 aid station where i past many of the 50 milers who were their 3040 mile range sooo i had nothing to complain about i had some potatoes  salt and actually got a runners high at mile 165 once again i was naive and thought this meant i was going to truck through the rest of the race hahaha it lasted for 5 miles but man that was a fantastic 5 mile stretch that i will cherish

i reached my friends again at mile 191 with my runners high long past me i took some photos with them desperately hoping that they were post race photos as my ankle started to nag me again  i knew that a new fresh hell awaited me with the falls roaring with an immense unrelenting ferocity to my right i could not let up miles 2030 were really just a blur i was lost in the woods in a state of mental fogginess looking for those damn blue ribbons to guide me to safety as the marathon runners past me going the opposite direction their kind words gave me more and more energy the more they came thank you kind runners i met up with a guy who i ran with for a little bit earlier who was now cramping pretty badly around mile 25 so i tried to will him to finish with me we were lewis  clark cutting through the wilderness with reckless abandon running at a full 2 minsmile slower than we were at the beginning and walking the steep hills as they taunted our demise

around mile 29 i saw a secret service agent roaming the trail above and realized i was passing the trump national golf course with what could have easily been a desert mirage i look to my left and see a golden shining figure to my left that could not be mistaken for anybody else but trump about 100 meters away going for a long putt huh interesting i thought as a 40mph gust punched me right in the gut with the longest 5 miles of my life behind me i reached the aid station at mile 30 not even comprehending how close to the finish line i actually was i was just chilling sparking up convo with the volunteers eating those glorious potatoes  salt when i was notified that i was actually in the top 20 with the final jolt of energy i would get i thanked the volunteers and bolted with a renewed love of life i reached mile 31 wondering where the finish line as i for some reason thought a 50k was 3107 miles and not 317 miles crap i just counted my steps to the end and mustered a sad excuse of a kick as my body that hated me reluctantly crossed the finish line

 postrace

i was in an utter daze as i meandered my way through the race festival my mind primitively went straight to food as the smell of woodfire pizza dancing in the air titillated the senses i got my 12 food voucher scarfed down at the time the most delicious pizza i had ever had and tried to make way to the shuttle so i could meet up with my friends still in a daze i couldnt find the shuttle to get back to the lot  had to call a lyft that poor driver i was drenched in 32 miles of sweat and dried mud anywho i finally made it to crooked run brewery in sterling where my friends greeted me with a beer  a melt burger if you are in the dc area you have to go to melt in leesburg best burger in the area pizza beer burgers  friends name a better postrace combo

that was a doozy  a half i loved my first 50k as someone who runs on paved trails the feeling of being in the woods on trails really only forged by footsteps induced a zenlike feeling the people were

training
i returned to running on april 30 2018 after basically taking a break since high school i was 35 when i took up running again 

for my first half marathon i was focused on finishing i used a 4 runsweek training plan did very little strength training stretching or fueling i ran my first half in kc last october and ran 20832 my first mile was 1030 and my last was 845 i had a lot of gas left in the tank 

for this half marathon i got more serious i maintained 1520 miles per week from novemberjanuary i also started doing strength training 34 timesweek in january

when i started this training cycle i ran 5 timesweek instead of 4 my times started dropping closer to 9 min average so i could see how an increase in mileage strength stretching and foam rolling was really helping 

i also bought honey stinger chews and used those on all my long runs 

the other new thing i tried was rotating 2 pairs of shoes that really seemed to help my joints 

i knew going into this half that i could likely run my a goal but it would be a stretch

prerace
nothing big to report here except i realized too late that i’d left my airpods in my bag so i guess it would be a half marathon with no music gasp it ended up being a nonissue the route was lovely and went by fast  

race
this race used pacers that did a smart pacing strategy i decided to stick with the 155 group and see how i felt as i went i was behind them for about half the race and felt really good and strong around mile 8 i passed that group 

i could see i was getting close to my 151 goal since my average pace was almost 830 and i felt like i had gas left in the tank so i should start pushing it some at mile 10 i started picking it up some more but worried it was too soon at mile 11 i was really pushing i was starting to feel like i’d hit my max but at 125 miles i saw i was at 144 and realized i could actually maybe go sub 150

the last half mile was brutal and i gave it all i had 

my first mile was 851 and my last mile was 715 i started to tear up shortly after finishing because i realized i’d crushed my a goal 

the feeling of satisfaction from simply putting in the work then setting a goal that’s just out of reach and then crushing that goal is something i will always carry with me 

moral of the story

1 run more miles
2 run more than 4 timesweek
3 strength train that core and glutes
4 streeeeettttccccchhhh every day 
5 foam roll every day 
6 nutrition and fuel matter 
7 rotate those shoes

postrace
my legs started feeling sore pretty soon after but i was on cloud 9 my husband and kids were there to hug me and i enjoyed the post race expo definitely got my medal engraved with my new pr

 training
before this race i had only ever run my home towns five mile turkey trot which i normally aim to complete in under an hour now why would i try to go from a five mile race to a half marathon well around two months ago my statistics professor had mentioned that he was doing the disney world marathon and told us if we wanted to get into running we could sign up for the tuscaloosa half marathon as i am the philanthropy chair of my fraternity i thought that this would be a great way to raise money and get in better shape 

i spoke to my professor after class and he told me i would want to slowly build up to around ten miles by running a couple of miles three times a week and then keep upping my mileage and to make sure to get out on the roads because treadmills are not the same i decided to mostly follow his advice and in the first few weeks i peaked at running 7 miles which i did twice but this is where i went off the rails a bit  i understand that this is completely my fault and i do not ask from pity from here on out but three weeks ago it was my spring break and i spent the whole week not running and instead drinking on the beaches of southern alabama the next week was our big party week and i again spent the whole week drinking and not running i decided that i would spend the week before the race making up for my two leisure weeks and getting back in shape but i came down with a bad cold and was unable to run for that week as well 

to recap the three weeks leading up to the half marathon drinking heavily and not running a single mile on top of just being out of shape i know this was a dumb move

 race strategy
if you started cringing at the last section you are really going to hate me now because at 8pm the night before the race i googled how to run a half marathon with little training luckily i found tips on what to eat for breakfast the day of and more importantly that i should get some energy chews to keep myself from running out of energy on mile 10 i drove to target got some gatorade energy chews and got a good nights sleep

i woke up at 530 am and started to make oatmeal with a sliced up banana which i had learned online was a decent pre race breakfast then it hit me that i had never picked up my race number so i looked on their website for information on where to pick it up and my heart dropped when i read that all race materials must be picked up the day before the race no race materials will be handed out the day of the race i  immediately drove to the starting point and was relieved when i saw many people lined up picking up their race materials as it turned out they just wanted to scare people into picking it up the day before 

i then realized i never thought of where to put my car keys so i did some quick googling and hid them in the hood of my car i did not know how to stretch for running so i then copied those around me until the race started
 race
i actually felt pretty great during the first 7 miles and i spent time snapping and texting updates to my friends every mile it was really cool to get to go around my city and have people cheering me on but then on mile 10 things started to go down hill at mile 6 i had started eating one of those gatorade chews every other mile to keep my energy up but in the last 3 miles it seemed like even those had no effect my knees and ankles started to hurt and i was breathing heavy but luckily i found a group of people at my pace and though we didnt agree on it out loud we would all jog together and then slow down when one of us needed to walk i stayed with this group until the finish line was in site and i decided to sprint to it i finished at a time of 3 hours and 13 seconds with an average pace of 13 minutes and 46 seconds
 postrace
after the race a local pizza restaurant was handing out free beer and pizza so i had some of that while i walked around for a bit because some experienced runners told me not to sit down immediately i took a nap for 2 hours popped an advil and then headed to a crawfsh boil party and restocked on carbohydrates through cheap beer before going out for margaritas

 whats next
everyone i know told me i would hate myself after and while i hate the pain that i caused myself i actually had a pretty fun time and i would like to do another one where i actually train properly additionally i raised over 600 dollars for the special olympics so that definitely do it again running seems like a pretty fun hobby and i am glad i tried to challenge myself even if i did it in the most boneheaded way possible 

please let me know where you think i should go from here point out things i should have done and feel free to scold me as i probably deserve it

website httpstuscaloosahalfcom goals goal  description  completed  a 4 hours  yes  b 3 hours  no  c finish  yes  trainingbefore this race i had only ever run my home towns five mile turkey trot which i normally aim to complete in under an hour now why would i try to go from a five mile race to a half marathon well around two months ago my statistics professor had mentioned that he was doing the disney world marathon and told us if we wanted to get into running we could sign up for the tuscaloosa half marathon as i am the philanthropy chair of my fraternity i thought that this would be a great way to raise money and get in better shape i spoke to my professor after class and he told me i would want to slowly build up to around ten miles by running a couple of miles three times a week and then keep upping my mileage and to make sure to get out on the roads because treadmills are not the same i decided to mostly follow his advice and in the first few weeks i peaked at running 7 miles which i did twice but this is where i went off the rails a bit  i understand that this is completely my fault and i do not ask from pity from here on out but three weeks ago it was my spring break and i spent the whole week not running and instead drinking on the beaches of southern alabama the next week was our big party week and i again spent the whole week drinking and not running i decided that i would spend the week before the race making up for my two leisure weeks and getting back in shape but i came down with a bad cold and was unable to run for that week as well to recap the three weeks leading up to the half marathon drinking heavily and not running a single mile on top of just being out of shape i know this was a dumb move race strategyif you started cringing at the last section you are really going to hate me now because at 8pm the night before the race i googled how to run a half marathon with little training luckily i found tips on what to eat for breakfast the day of and more importantly that i should get some energy chews to keep myself from running out of energy on mile 10 i drove to target got some gatorade energy chews and got a good nights sleep

after running 2 half marathons last september and getting a pr in the second one i wanted to make sure i kept up my running fitness over the winter according to strava my last half was 200 metres long and my official time was 13034 

ive become a bit of a francophile since going to bordeaux last summer with some friends and saw a paris half marathon a couple of days after my birthday

seeing an opportunity to kill 2 birds with one stone setting an official half marathon time of 130 and making sure that i continue to run over the winter i signed up convinced my family to come with me and booked an airbnb

my brother initially signed up but after injuring his knee skiing didnt recover enough from his physio appointments to take part which was a huge shame we both picked up running a few years ago to get fit i even lost 45lbs doing it and found that its really enjoyable

as part of the agreement with my girlfriend to pull our 6 year old out of school for 2 days we had to take him to disneyland on saturday the day before the race 
walking 12 hours around disneyland and having an airbnb up 5 flights of stairs was probably not the smartest decision ive ever made

 race
instant coffee in the apartment pastry en route and wearing a throwaway rain mac i was as ready as i could be considering i did none of my standard routine 
i wanted to follow the 130 pacer forget about my watch and just enjoy the race but he got right to the front by the elites and i didnt see him once
1st km was too fast but brass bands were playing  the tetris theme and songs from the full monty by the side of the road and i was having a lot of fun
the days before the forecast predicted heavy rain but fortunately it must have rained at 7am so i only had to contend with puddles the days was sunny and fairly warm
someone next to me got hit by a pedestrian on a bicycle and took a nasty spill on cobble stones at the 3km mark
5km mark saw my girlfriend son brother and his wife cheering me from a bridge my heart rate dropped at this moment according to strava and my spirit definitely lifted
i checked my watch every km even though i promised i wouldnt
took the first water from the station at km6 and chucked it over my head
had my first gel at km7
second gel at km14
23rds in and i felt the effects of not finding a pre race portaloo but i was so desperate to hit 130 refused to stop
km 1618 i was seriously considering pissing down my legs but the feeling subsided eventually
after this point the track felt like it was going gradually downhill i realised that i had no idea if i was on track to make my target time and stopped stressing about it
km 192 and saw that my watch said 120xx and realised that if i kept my pace i should be on course for a new pr
family were 200meters from the finish line and i sprinted to the end in 12942 tired but elated


 postrace
a full day walking around paris going to the aquarium up the eiffel tower before going for a fancy meal in montmartre and drinking wine and beer on the apartment

 training
my second marathon was april 2018 i dropped my time from 423 to 342 using hanson’s marathon method beginner plan i decided to try the advanced plan this time  i also started doing orangetheory last fall so i incorporated classes twiceaweek for strengthcross training benefits  in january i ran a half marathon pr 141 on a hilly course in cold rainy conditions so i felt confident that a bq was possible in april  i will be 35 for boston 2020 so bq time is 335  

i was diagnosed with a medical issue in early march first symptoms i noticed were that my workouts felt impossibly hard and even easy running spiked my heart rate  i skipped a lot of otf in march and froze my account for april  i still hit the majority of my scheduled runs but took extra rest days when needed  i was able to run a 10 mile race at the beginning of april with a 35 minute pr 11518  i hit target paces in my last 10 mile tempo run 10 days out which left me confident that 330 was still possible 

unfortunately i felt miserable the week leading up to the marathon  i shortened easy runs and skipped one altogether  even the day before i was undecided on running  however the likelihood of fitting another marathon in before summer is slim  also i’m cheap  it killed me to think of throwing the entry fee away  

 race strategy
since i decided to race anyway my plan was to go out conservatively and reassess  how i felt every mile  i planned to start with the 335 pace group 813mi  i negative split this marathon last year with an ultraconservative start plus the crowd makes it easier to keep the first mile or so easy 

 prerace
thursdaysaturday i carbloaded like a champ 450 grams of carbs each day  i slept terribly the night before but that is typical for me the night before a race  i ate a bagel and a banana around 230 am and tried to get a little extra sleep  around 500 i had coffee and orange juice  about 40 minutes out 2 scoops of generation ucan  bag check was easy but portapotty lines were long i luckily made it to my corral with 2 minutes to spare  it was too crowded to get to the 335 pace group but i could see the sign 

 race
i kind of felt like garbage in the first mile  and the second  but i eventually caught up with the 335 pace group and felt ok i hung for awhile before breaking off  i felt pretty good  staying hydrated and letting adrenaline carry me  i thought i had a good distance between the 335 group and myself and although i never saw the 330 group i figured as long as 335 didn’t pass me i’d be happy with my finish time  around mile 16 the 335 pacers were on my heels  i started freaking out and trying to outrun them  bad idea  by mile 19 i couldn’t keep up i started to slow eventually walking  a fellow runner encouraged me to keep going  thank you  and another checked on me when i started crying totally dramatic i know but everything hurt  miles 2025 were way off pace  i knew bq was out but still a chance for a pr i picked it up in mile 26 but no fast finish for me 

 postrace
although i missed my goals and hit the wall hard i still managed a 5 minute pr 

 whats next
i’m not sure honestly  i have the brooklyn half in a few weeks so the main focus is rest and recovery until then  i’m also working on nyrr 91 program for nyc marathon guaranteed entry in 2020  which means several smaller races sprinkled throughout this year  i know i have a 330 in me but will probably wait to try for boston 2021

,,,,,,"picture it october 2018 a few months ago you had taken up running as a warmup for other workouts and as a way to fill an hour between work and a friday night yoga class you’ve been wondering what hobby you’ll pick up during winter after tennis ends for the year you see an article about the chicago marathon and everyone finishing looks so happy they’re celebrating crying and limping all around you think “i  wonder if i could do that” so it began i signed up a full marathon so i wouldn’t get bored during the winter welcome reader to “uhannahjoy33’s first race ever” report

the race tobacco road marathonhttpstobaccoroadmarathoncom on march 17 2019
 

part i the training

i had run some in undergrad but never entered a race never really tracked distance or time and only ever gotten up to 12ish miles i figured i might as well go all in and make my first race a full marathon i read every article and guide i could find and came away with two things run as many miles as you can and if you have to miss a run don’t make it the long run i took those things very seriously i started my training the last week of october 

the good

 i definitely was prepared for my race see the bad point 3

 i had always been a slow runner so going at a slow easy pace was very natural for me 930 ‘fast’ pace and averaging 1000 for long runs

 i really started to love my long runs they were peaceful except towards the end when it was very cold and very rainy and once i incorporated podcasts i got to learn a lot too

 on my peak week i decided for one run to really push myself i ran 11 miles at a sub9 minute pace  rrunning didn’t raise no fool though so i knew that while i was excited about being able to hold that pace i sure as shit wasn’t going to try for it on race day maybe marathon 2…
 i finally began pt for my knees that have plagued me for years literally all it took like 57 minutes of it bandinner thigh exercises every night and i went from constant pain and knee braces to not needing any knee support
 beginning on christmas day i ran 9 20 mile runs and was able to adjust well to them recovery time went way down after about the 4th run
 my thighs look amazing 


the bad

 when my training started i was also in the tail end of my fall tennis season and going to 45 gym classes a week hiit strength cardio adding running to all of those led to plantar fasciitis and l dealt with that my entire training cycle
 i never did find a shoe that i loved i ended up in ghosts 11 but only because i disliked them the least justiceforkinvara4
 i overtrained somewhere in december i freaked out that i would never be ready by march for the race so i went from 30ish miles a week to 50 i was always achy and tired i stopped being able to do the full motion for squats and lunges because my knee mobility went waayyy down heres a weekly breakdown of my training and you can see at week 9 where the freakout washttpsiimgurcom5t8171ypng
 i flirted with the line of disordered eating about a month into training i completely lost my appetite i was literally never hungry being a former chubby kid and putting on weight after grad school i secretly felt like this was a blessing i used it as an excuse to eat a little as possible while still technically being able to run if i didn’t run or ran less than 8 miles i’d just eat a boiled egg for dinner 
 me as a human being i became a real twat and due to proximity i took most of it out on my boyfriend everything became centered around running and nothing else fit into this strict schedule i had built kisses on the way out the door no time i’ve got to get my run started when he sat me down to tell me that it seemed like i was unhappy with the relationship my first thought was “maybe i’m not being snippy maybe you’re being more annoying” he wasn’t he didn’t deserve to be treated like that and i’m glad he talked to me about it i was too far up my own ass to notice my behavior 
 my hormones for the first time in my life i started having period cramps and boy were they a doozy these were not at all fun and made for some miserable training runs
 i have two great fears in life trench foot and achilles tendons in high school i saw a gymnast’s tendon pop as she landed and i have never really recovered from how absolutely disgusting it was i have always lived in fear of my own achilles two weeks before the race it started to feel a little tight it wasn’t painful but the fact that i could even feel it freaked me out i tried to avoid all hills and tone down my paces this worry hung above me for two weeks straight 

the okay

 i really didn’t know anything about race pace i just kind of judged it based on what i felt was fast maybe i could have gone faster if i had done a few sample races or tried to do consistent speed work during the training cycle

 i did lose 20 pounds that i didn’t really need the method was uncontrolled and unhealthy but i guess that’s some silver lining

tldr if you can’t handle me at my training cycle that’s okay because i was probably being a shit


part ii the race

uh fucking fantastic honestly it could not have gone any better 

my plan was to hang out with the 415 pacer for the majority of the time and see how i felt in the last 10k and let that determine if i broke away well morning of all of the pacers decided to try their hands at invisibility and all i could see was a 450 pacer and a 335 so i just decided to start and try to find them along the course i started out pretty conservatively not wanting to the be the face of a bonk at the finish line around mile 4 i realized i was being too conservative and i needed to speed it up a bit finally i came up on a pacer and it was the 430 group so i knew i was well behind where i wanted to be i picked up the pace and kind of rode the “run slightly slower than you want to” until mile 20 plan my foot started getting a dull pain on contact around mile 18 right after i passed a water station so i dry swallowed an aleve and just committed to pushing past whatever pain came up once i hit mile 20 i just knew i had it i had so much energy in the bank my hips weren’t stiff at all and i felt fantastic i let loose and ran as fast as i could while keeping my heart rate under 180 i honestly just felt like i was running on air and i was breezing past everyone see splits herehttpswwwstravacomactivities2220109550

overall i’m thrilled with my finish i do wonder if i could have run faster overall but i’ll let that be decided at the next one 


stray thoughts

 the race began with half and full marathoners running together for the first 2 miles then splitting off in different directions there were a surprising number of people who within the first 12 miles were already off to the side sucking wind 
 there was a mimosa station nice but it was at a location where you passed it at mile 5 and 9ish way too early in the race for me to risk messing up my stomach would’ve appreciated them later in the day 
 the seventh day adventists know how to throw a support station party it was a huge group of people and they had such a great atmosphere even for the 25 foot length of distance they occupied it was impossible not to feel great running through that section
 at like mile 3 there was a woman who was executing her plan of walking and running in shifts which resulted in a mile or two of us taking turns passing each other no problem except for she is one of those people who don’t pick up their feet when they walk so even over my music i had to hear her cha cha sliding down the trail for like a mile
 i loved how many people were running the race to bring attention to different causes and charities it was great seeing people run in full military gear to bring attention to wounded soldiers or this one woman who finished the half marathon in 45 hours while wearing a shirt for an arthritis charity that is an insane amount of dedication and their finishes were well deserved 
 as much as i complained about the hills in my area during training i was so glad i had to run on them during the race which was very flat comparatively a few times i’d note runners saying “just gotta make it up this hill and then it’s downhill” and i’d think “oh are we even going uphill right now” the only time i noticed a hill was around mile 24525 when i was expecting a downhill finish and that was not what i got i mean technically the last 5 miles was downhill but that shouldn’t count and they know it 

part iii the aftermath

the leg soreness is manageable but i definitely took the elevator to second floor at work this morning

so what comes next

 fortunately i have a work conference one week after the race and that’ll give me some forced recovery time with no strenuous exercise
 chemical foot peel my second toes are in a right state with calluses i must purge them 
 spend some real time with my boyfriend spoil that ho he’s currently in professional school so we can’t really take an impromptu trip but i’m going to give the little things a go he wants a chicken sandwich we find a place that has a chicken sandwich and go get it he was wonderful through the whole training cycle and i know that if i decide to run another marathon that i will have to work to balance my running and personal life better 
 probably going to run twin cities in october or maybe indy i haven’t decided
 probably go see a counselor to address my overall allornothing personality so i can go into the next training cycle with a healthier mindset of how i literally need to eat to live and not just run
 wait for a sale on a forerunner 645 or vivoactive 3 strava frustrated me to no end during this cycle with frequently malfunctioning gps so i’m going to upgrade from my current fitbit to a gps watch 


appendix the mvp’s

 my quads you guys carried me through the first 3 months of training back when i didn’t know how to activate my hamstrings and glutes you guys are champs
 my knees we’ve always had a tough relationship but you guys really held on throughout the whole thing i know i pushed you further than i really should have but i appreciate that you toughed it out i’ll work on supporting muscles for a while to give you a break 
 my right foot you were great pointed stare at left foot
 ussk42 for being super reliable on liking my strava runs and always being cheery it always helped especially when i had bad runsweeks
 uvermilionweirdo for making me accept that i cant really call myself a slow runner anymore also for making me extra paranoid about my achilles
 uparkinskin for chatting about the ups and downs of training they also ran the same race as i and kicked ass


tldr trained like a maniac for a race it paid off 910 first race experience 


",182,0.97,hannahjoy33,"break up with your sanity, i'm bored: A Race Report",,,picture it october 2018 a few months ago you had taken up running as a warmup for other workouts and as a way to fill an hour between work and a friday night yoga class you’ve been wondering what hobby you’ll pick up during winter after tennis ends for the year you see an article about the chicago marathon and everyone finishing looks so happy they’re celebrating crying and limping all around you think “i  wonder if i could do that” so it began i signed up a full marathon so i wouldn’t get bored during the winter welcome reader to “uhannahjoy33’s first race ever” report goal  accomplishedfinish strong  oh yeahfinish  415  oh yeahfinish time 40755the race tobacco road marathonhttpstobaccoroadmarathoncom on march 17 2019 part i the trainingi had run some in undergrad but never entered a race never really tracked distance or time and only ever gotten up to 12ish miles i figured i might as well go all in and make my first race a full marathon i read every article and guide i could find and came away with two things run as many miles as you can and if you have to miss a run don’t make it the long run i took those things very seriously i started my training the last week of october the good i definitely was prepared for my race see the bad point 3 i had always been a slow runner so going at a slow easy pace was very natural for me 930 ‘fast’ pace and averaging 1000 for long runs i really started to love my long runs they were peaceful except towards the end when it was very cold and very rainy and once i incorporated podcasts i got to learn a lot too on my peak week i decided for one run to really push myself i ran 11 miles at a sub9 minute pace  rrunning didn’t raise no fool though so i knew that while i was excited about being able to hold that pace i sure as shit wasn’t going to try for it on race day maybe marathon 2… i finally began pt for my knees that have plagued me for years literally all it took like 57 minutes of it bandinner thigh exercises every night and i went from constant pain and knee braces to not needing any knee support beginning on christmas day i ran 9 20 mile runs and was able to adjust well to them recovery time went way down after about the 4th run my thighs look amazing the bad when my training started i was also in the tail end of my fall tennis season and going to 45 gym classes a week hiit strength cardio adding running to all of those led to plantar fasciitis and l dealt with that my entire training cycle i never did find a shoe that i loved i ended up in ghosts 11 but only because i disliked them the least justiceforkinvara4 i overtrained somewhere in december i freaked out that i would never be ready by march for the race so i went from 30ish miles a week to 50 i was always achy and tired i stopped being able to do the full motion for squats and lunges because my knee mobility went waayyy down heres a weekly breakdown of my training and you can see at week 9 where the freakout washttpsiimgurcom5t8171ypng i flirted with the line of disordered eating about a month into training i completely lost my appetite i was literally never hungry being a former chubby kid and putting on weight after grad school i secretly felt like this was a blessing i used it as an excuse to eat a little as possible while still technically being able to run if i didn’t run or ran less than 8 miles i’d just eat a boiled egg for dinner  me as a human being i became a real twat and due to proximity i took most of it out on my boyfriend everything became centered around running and nothing else fit into this strict schedule i had built kisses on the way out the door no time i’ve got to get my run started when he sat me down to tell me that it seemed like i was unhappy with the relationship my first thought was “maybe i’m not being snippy maybe you’re being more annoying” he wasn’t he didn’t deserve to be treated like that and i’m glad he talked to me about it i was too far up my own ass to notice my behavior  my hormones for the first time in my life i started having period cramps and boy were they a doozy these were not at all fun and made for some miserable training runs i have two great fears in life trench foot and achilles tendons in high school i saw a gymnast’s tendon pop as she landed and i have never really recovered from how absolutely disgusting it was i have always lived in fear of my own achilles two weeks before the race it started to feel a little tight it wasn’t painful but the fact that i could even feel it freaked me out i tried to avoid all hills and tone down my paces this worry hung above me for two weeks straight the okay i really didn’t know anything about race pace i just kind of judged it based on what i felt was fast maybe i could have gone faster if i had done a few sample races or tried to do consistent speed work during the training cycle i did lose 20 pounds that i didn’t really need the method was uncontrolled and unhealthy but i guess that’s some silver liningtldr if you can’t handle me at my training cycle that’s okay because i was probably being a shitpart

determine if i broke away well morning of all of the pacers decided to try their hands at invisibility and all i could see was a 450 pacer and a 335 so i just decided to start and try to find them along the course i started out pretty conservatively not wanting to the be the face of a bonk at the finish line around mile 4 i realized i was being too conservative and i needed to speed it up a bit finally i came up on a pacer and it was the 430 group so i knew i was well behind where i wanted to be i picked up the pace and kind of rode the “run slightly slower than you want to” until mile 20 plan my foot started getting a dull pain on contact around mile 18 right after i passed a water station so i dry swallowed an aleve and just committed to pushing past whatever pain came up once i hit mile 20 i just knew i had it i had so much energy in the bank my hips weren’t stiff at all and i felt fantastic i let loose and ran as fast as i could while keeping my heart rate under 180 i honestly

 havent seen a race report for london so thought id get the ball rolling 

 training

i started running a few miles a week early last year and entered the london marathon via ballot and for my chosen charity dogs trust and was unsuccessful with both  i then injured my mcl quite badly playing basketball in august and didnt really run again until october i then got a call in mid october from dogs trust saying they had a place in the marathon available if i was still keen  absolutely i then spent late october to mid december just building a base mileage up and then loosely followed a runners world 16 week training plan in the build up i raced two half marathons 153  146 that went well and had me feeling confident that i may be able to beat 4 hours on the day if things went well 

 prerace

carb loaded for the first time in my life from thursday morning  ill be honest as a foodie i thought i would absolutely love this however taking in pure carbs had me feeling pretty full from thursday morning  saturday night which made me think i might have messed it up i spent the saturday watching avengers end game which was a nice way to spend three hours not thinking about the marathon

i woke up at 520 feeling good and no longer super full which was a relief i got ready and had a bagel  banana in the car to london i live about 30 mins from the nearest station followed by another banana about 730 on the train a friend from university who i hadnt seen in 5 years was also running the marathon and as luck would have it was in the same start zone as me so we spent the morning catching up which was perfect as it meant i didnt really have time to get nervous over thinking the race 

 race

absolutely amazing honestly running this marathon is one of the best and most enjoyable things ive ever done the crowds and atmosphere are unlike anything i could have ever imagined and im so so thankful to every person that cheered a bunch of randoms fueling went well and i took on 5 maurten gels  one of the lucazade pods  thankfully didnt have to make any toilet stops either 

i do think i got a little too caught up in just enjoying the moment as i wasnt focusing on my pace as much as i probably should have been early on which meant i hit the halfway point around 35 mins slower than i wantedexpected  i tried to kick on in the second half but didnt do enough to make up the lost time and then i hit the wall around mile 22 and had two considerably slow miles for myself at this point i was also pretty hot so chucked my hat to the side kind of regret that now as i need to buy another one for summer running 

managed to push on and speed up the last two miles but sub 4 wasnt going to be achieved today finishing at 40249 

 postrace

crossed the finish line and collected my things and met up with my family friends and girlfriend where we headed off to a nearby pub and enjoyed a few celebratory beers after properly rehydrating of course my feet were in a bad way after with my pinkie losing its toenail rip  a few days of aching

i absolutely loved running this marathon and have got a running coach in place for my next effort chicago 2019 i do think i neglected speed workhillsintervals a little bit in my training so would imagine these to play a larger role in my effort for chicago and with a running coach and more of an understanding of how a marathon is run in place im hoping for sub 350 in october

 training

this was a tuneup race for an upcoming half marathon im following petes 1247 plan ive stuck to the plan to a t minus getting the flu and missing almost a full week of running my easy runs average a 10minmile pace and lt runs at 750mile pace courtesy of our wisconsin winter training runs were mostly done on a treadmill but most of the long runs outside on road this was supposed to be my second 10k tuneup for the year but my first was canceled i ended up doing a 10k time trial instead on a treadmill and finished in 4700 decided last minute 4500 712mile would be my goal for the race

x200b

 prerace

545 am wakeup shower dress and car packed for a 75minute drive to the race i normally dont eat before my 56am morning runs but with a 915 start i had some cheese curds on my drive cuz wisconsin i arrived an hour before the race start grabbed my packet and tshirt and then went back to my car for a little rest before warming up the weather was a perfect mid 50s sunny with little clouds

x200b

i knew with this being a smaller local race i had a good chance of placing within my age group approaching the starting area i scoped the crowd for anyone who might be in my division not seeing many i noticed a built gentleman with massive quads who i dubbed major quads and figured hed be the guy to beat with the half marathon starting at 900 the 5k and 10k racers both lined up for the 915 start i took my place near the front afraid to get stuck behind walkers like ive heard happening to others the countdown commenced and we were off

x200b

 race

 miles 1 to 2

the first 100 meters of the race is a slight downhill curve that uturns and merges with the trail wed be running on once on the trail there we two racers in front of me while i was shouldertoshoulder with major quads and a female racer i couldnt come up with a nickname for other than the chick i was feeling good probably too good for my own good and began to pull ahead my watch galaxy watch isnt the best for realtime pacing so when i saw a 6 45mile pace at mile 1 when the plan was 712 i was a little nervous i decided to go off feel that banking time early might be for the best and tried to settle in

x200b

this plan worked for about 10 seconds the two racers who were about 200 meters in front of me had turned at the 5k turnaround and i suddenly found myself out in front never did i expect to be at the front of a race it was unsettling i was too busy crunching numbers thinking about potential placing to focus on running the race i had planned i looked back and saw 2nd place 20 meters back foolishly i increased my pace a tad to place some distance between us start fast and hold on right

x200b

 miles 3 to 4

not long after entering the third mile i was shouldertoshoulder with second place which doesnt make him second place anymore i suppose so well call him art he told me afterward that he teaches art as my watch turned over 25 miles the two of us got chicked by the chick she was cruising and quickly left us behind i tailed her hoping itd motivate my heavy legs to maintain a sub7 pace but as we approached the 10k turnaround i started falling back art was back on top of me and cleared me before we doubled back the start of the second half was on and i wasnt sure how much i had left in the tank my legs felt slow and heavy i bunkered down and pushed to keep my cadence high and my form tight

x200b

 miles 5 to 625

art kept a firm 2030 meters on me the remainder of the race and the chick had an insurmountable lead on us both i approached the last aid station not wanting a drink i yelled to the volunteers to just throw it at me they laughed but kept holding out cups i grabbed one threw some in my mouth choked threw the rest on me and spat what i attempted to swallow in that order i had 8 minutes to finish the last mile for a 4500 time which i knew was just a matter of continuing to put one foot in front of the other and keep pounding

x200b

as i took the final turn back up to the finish where we had started i glanced behind me only to see major quads 10 meters back id be damned if those quads were built for sprinting so i mustered up everything i had left and trucked uphill to a 4341 finish

x200b

 postrace

i congratulated the chick and art and shot the shit with major quads until they gave out awards received my 1st place medal for my age group and then grabbed some bbq from the event caterer and an ice cold beer from the venue the race was hosted at vines and rushes winery just north of ripon a beautiful venue and very welcoming to the runners i thought this was a great eventrace that was very well run ill certainly try to make it back next year

focus on running the race i had planned i looked back and saw 2nd place 20 meters back foolishly i increased my pace a tad to place some distance between us start fast and hold on rightx200b miles 3 to 4not long after entering the third mile i was shouldertoshoulder with second place which doesnt make him second place anymore i suppose so well call him art he told me afterward that he teaches art as my watch turned over 25 miles the two of us got chicked by the chick she was cruising and quickly left us behind i tailed her hoping itd motivate my heavy legs to maintain a sub7 pace but as we approached the 10k turnaround i started falling back art was back on top of me and cleared me before we doubled back the start of the second half was on and i wasnt sure how much i had left in the tank my legs felt slow and heavy i bunkered down and pushed to keep my cadence high and my form tightx200b miles 5 to 625art kept a firm 2030 meters on me the remainder of the race and the chick had an insurmountable lead on us both i approached the last aid station not wanting a drink i yelled to the volunteers to just throw it at me they laughed but kept holding out cups i grabbed one threw some in my mouth choked threw the rest on me and spat what i attempted to swallow in that order i had 8 minutes to finish the last mile for a 4500 time which i knew was just a matter of continuing to put one foot in front of the other and keep poundingx200bas i took the final turn back up to the finish where we had started i glanced behind me only to see major quads 10 meters back id be damned if those quads were built for sprinting so i mustered up everything i had left and trucked uphill to a 4341 finishx200b postracei congratulated the chick and art and shot the shit with major quads until they gave out awards received my 1st place medal for my age group and then grabbed some bbq from the event caterer and an ice cold beer from the venue the race was hosted at vines and rushes winery just north of ripon a beautiful venue and very welcoming to the runners i thought this was a great eventrace that was very well run ill certainly try to make it back next yearx200bthis post was

 training
since qualifying for boston in may 2018 with a time of 25355 i ran a few races from 15khalf marathon in 2018 and then planned to do a pfitz 1870 plan in the leadup to boston  i had difficulty fitting in training runs over christmas holidays especially with a newborn child so i decided to just base train until february and do a 1270 plan instead

this training cycle was not ideal  trying to fit high mileage weeks in the middle of canadian winter was difficult and i also was battling some nagging aches and pains from a raceheavy schedule and muscle imbalances from a lack of strength training  my achilles tib post adductors and si joint would flare up from time to time and force me to back off the mileage or intensity  i also didnt have the same fire that i had in the build up to my bq race and honestly just skipped a couple runs because i wasnt feeling motivated  the end result was a very short 4 week peak period where i was over 60 miles with a peak week of 68  after running a tune up half marathon 12448 and a 10k time trial 3900 in february my ankles flared up again and i ended up just doing an extended 5 week taper of under 30 miles because i decided id rather come to boston undertrained rather than injured  up until the start of the race i was worried that my ankles wouldnt hold up

 prerace
i arrived in boston on saturday afternoon and shortly after settling into my hotel went on a short shakeout run with a few running buddies  on sunday we had a meetup at tracksmith and did another 5k shakeout run  race expo on sunday afternoon and then back to the hotel early to get my race kit set up

i woke up at 500 am on monday and discovered that the forecast had changed at the last minute to pouring rain and thunder up until the race started then decreasing clouds and temps peaking in the high 60s during the race  after a quick breakfast at the hotel we went to the bus pickup for a 60 minute drive to the athletes village at hopkinton where we stood around in a muddy field for 90 minutes until the milelong parade to the race start  while i waited in the village i ran into a few people i knew and we chatted about race strategies while i downed a package of clif gels drank 2 cups of coffee and ate a banana and protein shake and made multiple trips to the porta potty

after what seemed like forever we were mustered at the start line the anthem played some jets did a flyover the elite runners took off and at 1002 the rest of the mortals were set loose on the course

 miles 1 to 10
the first part of the course is a steady downhill and i was placed right in the middle of the first wave of runners  while it was insanely crowded it wasnt too bad because everyone was moving fairly quickly  i focused on trying to stay in a pocket behind a couple runners and trying not to break stride to dodge other runners  my strategy for this race was to aim for splits in the 645650 range during the initial downhill section and then reevaluate the intensity level once the course leveled out and the pack spread out a bit  i noted through the first 5k that i was feeling pretty good and my pace was right where i wanted it but my heart rate was pretty high pushing up to 170 which is a bit higher than id like early in the race  i eased off the pace just a little bit to try to get my heart rate down a little

my fueling strategy was to grab gatorade at the aid station at every oddnumbered mile and to take one of my 4 gus every half hour or so  i popped my first one and grabbed a drink at mile 3  i noticed that i was sweating quite a bit in the humidity so i also started grabbing water at every aid station and dumping it on my head to try to stay cool

despite slowing down a little bit and doing what i could to cool off my heart rate stayed up about 175 at the 10k mark and the effort to maintain pace was already starting to get harder i like to follow the 101010 rule where the first 10 miles should feel easy second 10 miles feels a bit difficult final 10k feels hard  i was starting to realize that this race might hurt a little down with the second gu at the 1 hour mark

for miles 6 to 10 i fought to maintain my pace but i was starting to realize it was unsustainable  i was being passed by the majority of the pack and having trouble latching onto a runner  my heart rate was still high and my hamstrings were starting to burn a little bit from the effort  my breathing was good but i didnt trust my leg strength  when i passed the 15k mark and my pace continued to slow i decided to abandon my time goal and just enjoy the experience

 miles 10 to 18
i plodded along at a much more comfortable 715730 pace for the next few miles  another gu down at 130  continue to hydrate with gatorade and cool off with water  slow down on the uphills and coast down the declines  approaching the scream tunnel at 13 miles you could hear it from a mile away and it gave me goosebumps  i shamelessly high fived pretty much every girl as i ran by and borrowed their energy to spur me on  in fact the cheering of the crowd realy did energize me and keep my spirits up and i was having a good time despite knowing my time goals were out of reach  things seemed to be going relatively okay until i reached newton and the start of the infamous hills

 miles 18 to finish
by mile 18 i wasnt feeling great  my legs had gone from uncomfortable to painful and my pace was starting to drop down into the 800 range  i told myself that i should at least try to finish the race without walking as id never have to stop and walk during a marathon before  however a couple steps before the 30k mat at around the 185 miles disaster struck  my left hamstring suddenly seized up without warning and stopped me in my tracks 34 of the way up the first hill in newton  it was so intense that i couldnt do anything but hold my leg straight out in front of me try to put weight on it and wait for it to let go  a spectator took pity on me and gave me a water bottle which i chugged in one go  my left hamstring finally loosened and i went to take another step and my right hamstring cramped up  so i had to stand there for another minute or so until it felt safe to walk on again  i finally took a few ginger steps and after some time felt like i could run again  it didnt feel to me like a true marathon bonk  i didnt have the lightheadedness or sluggish feeling that you get when your muscles run out of glycogen  but i could feel that even the muscles in my forearms were trying to cramp on me so i figured it was more likely heat crampsdehydration  from that point on i grabbed at least one water or gatorade at every mile aid station  i was worried about hyponatremia so i took in as much sugarelectolytes as my stomach could handle  i ended up taking 6 energy gels and probably 15 gatorades during the course and probably an equal amount of water as well

the rest of the race was just about survival  i had to alter my gait to not stress my hamstrings too much which made my stride short and slow  i would jog for a mile or so and then get rocked with another hamstring cramp which would stop me for 30 seconds to a minute  i think it happened about 6 times  the crowd was very encouraging calling out to me telling me to keep going and i think it helped keep my spirits up  i passed a friend cheering at about mile 23 and put on a brave face until she asked me how i felt  i responded with oh im suffering

my wife and daughter were waiting for me at mile 24 and again i put on a brave face for them and willed my legs to keep me going  at that point the crowd was getting bigger and louder and we were making the final descent into downtown boston  i used every ounce of willpower i had left to force my body to keep going forward and despite only going at a slowerthan900 pace my legs mercifully didnt cramp again on me  as i made the final turn down boylston and spotted the finish line i choked up a little bit knowing that i was finally about to fufill the promise i made to myself 8 years ago after running my first marathon and finish the boston marathon  i crossed the line with my head held high in 335 flat
 postrace
i was in all kinds of pain when i crossed the finish line  i chugged a bottle of water and four cups of gatorade in between snivelling gasps of air  collected my medal which chowing down on bananas and clif bars  grabbed my gear back and promptly sat down on the street where i didnt move for probably 15 minutes  gave myself a sarcastic cheer when i was able to stand back up without assistance  hobble walked to tracksmith where my wife was waiting for me and then went to a ramen restaurant and ate 60 worth of ramen

under any other circumstances i would consider my performance a disappointment  i set a personal worst time by 24 minutes and had to walk sections of a course for the first time ever  but honestly on some level i was prepared for this outcome  i knew that my body has been redlining for the past few months and im in serious need of some rest recovery and remedial training to build up my strength and flexibility  i knew that this training cycle was woefully inferior to my bq cycle  i failed to recognize and adjust to the heat and humidity on the course  but i also ran the gutsiest race ive ever done willing myself to go on despite the worst pain ive experienced while running  i showed that i was able to dig deep and find something within myself to push myself harder  i hopefully will recognize those warning signs in the future and wont disrespect the marathon distance again with inadequate training

and honestly just running boston is an accomplishment and something that every long distance runner should try to experience for themselves

 whats next
no more running for a while  im getting my ass to the gym and building up my strength while i give myself a chance to fully recover from the issues that have been holding me back from training to my full potential  my goal is to not do any serious runs for a month  after that im going to do some speedwork and try to race a 10k in july and if all goes well try to best my half marathon pr in the fall

 training

i started running right after christmas with the active couch to 5k app i knew that in order to keep up with my training once i finished the app which i did on 221 i would need to set a new goal so since then ive been running with the active 5k to 10k app which incorporates a lot of intervals and increases your long runs fairly quickly over the last month ive also added in yoga 34 times a week to build up flexibility and balance 

 prerace

i woke up early to drive from my house to napa picking up my friendcheerleaderpersonal photographer along the way sipped my normal morning coffee on the 1 hr drive arrived at start line around 650 half marathon kicked off around 730 and 5k started around 750 

 race

mile 1 cold so cold i was wearing leggings and a tank top and it was 40 degrees out i knew it would be cold but didnt think it would affect me as much i kept up a good pace but could definitely feel that despite stretching my quads were tight i found a nearby runner whose pace seemed to match mine well and decided to try and stick near her as long as i could 

x200b

mile 2 began to defrost there was a hill why i checked strava afterwards and apparently the overall elevation gain was 83 feet that all came within about 2 minutes of running not a huge deal but i wasnt expecting it and it definitely had me worried about losing steam felt a slight stitch in my side after the hill but focused on breathing deeply and regularly and it faded pretty quickly by the end of this mile my fingers were tingling as they finally regained some circulation prerace gloves are going on the checklist for next race this was my slowest mile 

x200b

mile 3 i was still by the same runner id picked at the start we ended up finishing at the same time i decided to try and pass a few people up in the last mile to give myself a little motivation a lot of people in front of me had started walking and i got a thrill getting to run by them i could feel that i was getting a bit tired but was not about to slow down at this point so i turned up my music and powered through i wish i had remembered to be more cognizant of my form at this point but ultimately it was my fastest mile 

 postrace

i did it i was so damn excited to see that finish line grab my medal and chug some water my lovely friend took many sweaty redfaced photos of me with my new bling i checked my time and realized i had prd my previous 5k record was 3115 a few weeks ago and i got down to 3006 the race environment definitely makes a difference i have another 5k in two weeks and am hoping to break the 30 minute mark will report back regardless

 a 35 hours  no 
 b finish  yes 

im a slow new 40year old runner  i decided to post this race report in case there were other folks like me thinking about jumping into the deep end of running  im slow not athletic and new to running  but i challenged myself to do a half marathon and i totally did it

 training
after i signed up i swore i would train correctly but then of course i didnt  about 3 months before the race i started a half training plan but only completed about half the runs  one week before i did an 8mile jogwalk which was my longest in my life  i almost dropped down to the 5k but i really wanted to push myself and see if i could at least finish the half  the race had a 4 hour time limit so i figured even at my turtle pace of 1516 minute miles i should be able to avoid getting swept off the course

 race
i felt pretty amazing for the first 10 miles  i kept a steady 1530 pace by power walking and jogging and used clif bloks every 4 miles for energy  the hills were brutal  i live in a flat city and had not been able to train with elevation at all  i found the downhills actually hurt worse  but overall the scenery so many wineries my playlist and the other runners kept me happy and motivated  around mile 11 my left ankle started hurting i have an old injury and by mile 12 i was limping very very slowly   there was a point where i honestly thought i wouldnt be able to finish but damned if i was going to make it that far and give up  

i ended up finishing with a time of 337  nothing to jump up and down over but i was proud to even cross the finish line  plus there was a lot of wine after so that helped

 postrace
we immediately started drinking wine so by race night i was feeling pretty alright just a little stiff and very hungry  the next morning was a different story i limped through 2 days of wine tours and pretty much everything below the waist hurt  my ankle remains sore but stiffness in both hips was probably the worst problem i havehad  im now a week out from the race and finally not having to eat ibuprofen every 4 hours  

 whats next
i took the week off running completely but am starting back fresh tomorrow  i have a 10k in about a month and i signed up for a local half in november  im really going to train this time starting all the way over with a 5k plan to work on increasing speed  im also going to add in some strength training and stretching to help my old limbs handle the distance better  

i will never win any awards or be remotely competitive but im learning to be ok with that  im enjoying my new hobby and i know it will make me stronger and healthier  plus the shiny medals look awesome on my wall

 training

on december 7 2018 they announced that the registration date would be january 29 2019 at 6 am the morning of the 29th i woke up early to make sure i was accessing the registration correctly right at 6 am i tried to register and kept getting an error message so i reached out to the organization and they said that more than 14000 people were trying to register for 1500 spots eventually i was able to get through the system and snag my spot for the race at this point i had already decided that i wanted to run my first half marathon in may so i incorporated this race into my scheduled training runs on mapmyrun i previously ran a 15k the beginning of march and my longest training run so far was 10 miles average weekly mileage this year was about 22 miles 

 prerace

packet pickup was friday night at a hotel in marathon and was very organized calling people into the room strategically based on their last name the day of was so hot and humid woke up around 530 am to have breakfast oatmeal with peanut butter emergenc and lots of water stayed at a hotel about a mile from the start of the bridge left hotel around 630 for a 720 am start 

 race

at promptly 720 am the race began and according to mapmyrun it was 81 degrees f and 74 humidity miles 025 were easy and flat then at 25 miles the incline up the hump of the bridge began and at 3 miles the descent from 357 was pretty flat again but by this point it was so sunny hot and humid that it was a real struggle there is a small strip of shade if you stay to the left side of the bridge it’ll just cover from your knees down but it felt like it helped with the direct sun and heat throughout the race there were plenty of water stations 5 or 6 i think a couple stations of people handing out ice cold sponges to cool down which were fantastic a fire truck set up across the bridge misting cool water over the runners and one station about 5 miles in with people handing out strawberries oranges and watermelon the bridge must promptly reopen at 9 am so school buses began making their way across the bridge starting at 825 am and picked up the runners who would not be able to finish by 9 once i was about 01 miles from the finish line there were a bunch of people cheering with signs saying that you beat the bus it was so great seeing them after a tough race i finished 35 seconds under my goal time and was thrilled because it was definitely harder than i expected 

 postrace

after the race everyone gets on school buses that take you back to the marathon side of the bridge where the after party is located the after party was pretty typical live music gatorade beer results posted photo ops etc overall a very organized race with great volunteers this race gave me some much needed confidence before my half marathon in may and i hope to be able to run it again next year

 training
after i got in the vt 100 miler lottery for this summer i have been training for my first 100 mile run my first 50 miler was last nov the training plans ive looked at said to try not to exceed 50kday or 70 milesweek and to ratchet up week by week with longer runs to check nutrition and gear ive been running 3040 miles a week for the last month or two and feeling pretty good after finding out my iron was too low to donate blood and taking supplements i ran a pre50 mile 50k last fall and blew up in my nutrition walking a bunch of it and feeling like i was going to throw up for most of it so my hope was to treat this as a nice training run and check how i was doing

 prerace
being this was more of a training run i started the week with a few runs putting my mileage at 25 miles i had a work trip to fl which got me back late thursday night 12am so i tried to get to bed early friday night and up at 0420 for some eggs and a coffee my wife was nice enough to wake up to drop me off at the shuttle and i went and stood in the cold wind in my shorts for an hour before the race started there was a last minute announcement that the president and the japanese pm were golfing on part of the course so we were cautioned to stay on the trail and do not reach into your bag if there are secret service around

 race
there was a downpour yesterday and tornado warning yesterday so there were large regions of standing water on the trail the first 7 miles or so were muddy with people sliding in and falling down lots of careful stepping at a slow pace once we hit the first hill it dried up and was some lovely runable singletrack or fire roads with the occasional steep hill i was feeling pretty good throughout except a small rubbing on my pinky toe i found a good group of people to chat with and the miles kept clicking by the final 13 miles overlapped with the 50m and the marathon course so it got busier and we got passed a bit more but i tried to keep a 1112 minmi pace the sun came out and dried up most of the mud so the return was in nearperfect shape allowing for smooth running the whole way i did see some secret service and cops and diligently stayed on the trail with my hands away from my bag feeling good until about the last mile

the last mile i was feeling pretty demoralized as my gps was off by an unknown amount and i thought we had this extra loop we had to do but this woman blew past me marathon relayer blaring call me maybe which at the time i found hilarious and with her shout that there was only one more turn i sped up a bit more and came into the finish area complete with overlyenthusiastic guy on the microphone i was hoping for under 630 when i got close but my last mile just missed that overall i managed to run the whole thing except for the steep andor technical bits and even with my dip i felt pretty good the whole time and not totally gassed at the end

 postrace
once i got the medal i made a beeline for the beer garden and pounded a cool beer and some doughnut holes thank you strangers for that my wife arrived and we sat in the oversized beanbag chairs which is a great idea for race directors out there and waited for a personal pizza to cap out the event once home it was shower and nap time and tomorrow hopefully ill be feeling good enough for another 1015 miles tomorrow

training
i followed some free intermediate marathon training plan i had found online for this race it was pretty typical with an easy run tempo run interval run and long run each week my highest mileage run ended up being 213 miles  i had also been holding paces all around 830840 per mile on all my long runs which is exciting because i have never been this fast i have done one marathon before 2 years ago and went 444 then i did an ironman in october and went 447 so i knew i could go much faster


my training was going well until about 3 weeks ago my right hip began hurting this is some weird injury ive had for the past couple of years ive had mris on it and no one can figure it out what it is it comes and goes but when it hurts it hurts a lot so after the 20 mile run i decided to not run on weekdays and just did my sunday long runs up until the race to keep it from flaring up this was a wise choice because i didnt have any issues on race day   


prerace
i was woken up at 230am because two drunk guys were loudly fighting outside of my apartment i live in a pretty quiet complex but of course this had to happen the night before my race the police came and they shut up but after that i just couldnt get back to sleep i got out of bed at 345 and made coffee and kodiak cake pancakes then i took some ibuprofen and imodium part of a balanced breakfast which is a prerace ritual for me 


i left my place at 5am and i only live about 10 minutes from the race start so i got there very early in fact i was the first person in my corral this was nice because i had first dibs on a fresh clean porta potty for my prerace nervous pee i then lined up in the front  of the corral unfortunately i was in a slower corral than i would have liked because i submitted my previous marathon time based on the time i wanted to go i should have been like 3 corrals up 


race
the race started at 630 and my corral started at about 645 luckily there werent too many walkers ahead of me so i didnt have to dodge people a lot i started out pretty quick probably too quick but i was just so excited i dialed it back a bit around mile 2 and tried to hold closer to an 830 pace this is a pretty hilly race especially the first half so i didnt want kill my legs by going faster than my body was used to 


the first 8 miles flew by which was great because the longest and biggest hill is within that first 8 miles honestly i didnt even really notice the hill probably because i actually trained hills for this race wow imagine that between mile 8 and 9 the half and the full split the full goes right and the half goes left this is where my parents stand and cheer for me every year its always exciting to see them and it gives me a little boost of energy 


i kept an eye on my watch so i could take note of my time at the half marathon point i ended up going 150 in my half according to my garmin which is my fastest half ever by like 2 minutes oops i probably should have chilled out a bit in the first half i still felt strong until about mile 17 when my legs started feeling a little heavy and my brain was feeling a little foggy i figured it was time to take a clif shot i had been eating some clif bloks throughout the race already but the shot had caffeine in it this literally replenished me i was a new woman for like 10 minutes until the caffeine wore off and i needed another one 


around mile 20 i kind of wanted to die my legs were very heavy and i still had 6 miles left six miles thats a lot so i started breaking it up in my head in a more positive way for example i would think only three more miles until mile 23 then youll be so close to the finish this thinking really did help me 


at mile 22 the random physical ailments began my left knee started hurting and i never have knee pain so like wtf then i think i was running kind of weird to compensate for the knee pain and my lower back started hurting too then i got a side stitch that was so bad i couldnt breathe and had to stop to walk for second my only time walking seriously a side stitch is this amateur hour the stitch wouldnt go away so i decided to stop being a little bitch start running again and just breathe through the pain this actually worked i also kept getting horrible cramps in both feet which is pretty normal for me because of my high arches but it was still irritating


by mile 24 i could not be more excited to be done running i wanted to walk so bad but i knew if i just kept running then i would be done sooner i kept plodding along for the next mile and a half doing some sort of weird hunched over limprun


in the last half mile i tried to get my act together and run as fast as i could because i could see the finish line in the distance i crossed the finish lined stopped my watch and realized i met my goal my only goal for this race was to break 4 hours and my time ended up being 357 it would have been nice to go under 350 but ill just save that for next time and i was pretty happy with the fact that i had dropped nearly 40 minutes fro my previous marathon time


postrace
i met up with my parents for lunch at one of my favorite restaurants that also happens to be next to the finish line sadly though i had no appetite and could only eat a few bites  i then went home showered and laid in bed it was a beautiful day in cincinnati yesterday and i kept thinking i should go sit outside or something but instead i ended up falling asleep from 1430 then while all my friends were out enjoying the weather and cinco de mayo i was going to bed at 8pm 


today i am quite sore and im limping a little bit which is to be expected but i have to say the thing that hurts most of all is my right inner thigh because it got soooo chafed the shorts i wore for the race are usually great and never chafe me but they betrayed me 


whats next

well i plan on not doing any physical activity for most of this week for sure i am signed up for an ironman this coming september and my 20 week training plan was supposed to start on april 21 so i should probably start thinking about that i think i will definitely take a week or two off of running though to let my hip recover and will mainly focus on biking which is secretly my favorite dont tell running 


as far as just running goes i would like to eventually do a flat marathon ive only done the flying pig which is pretty hill and i would like to see how fast i can go on a flatter

am signed up for an ironman this coming september and my 20 week training plan was supposed to start on april 21 so i should probably start thinking about that i think i will definitely take a week or two off of running though to let my hip recover and will mainly focus on biking which is secretly my favorite dont tell running as far as just running goes i would like to eventually do a flat marathon ive only done the flying pig which is pretty hill and i would like to see how fast i can go on a flatter course

 training
i started training back in november  id ran a couple of half marathons in 141 and 139 and was happy with my fitness and stamina enough that i felt a solid training base would give me a good chance in my first full marathon i followed the runners world training plan and modified it a bit to suit my ability at that point 

training was going brilliantly  i was disciplined and got myself out no matter the weather including some very snowy evenings i was averaging 4045 miles a week throughout january in february an old injury started to niggle again quad strain so i eased back somewhat but still felt comfortable with my training as well as the long runs on a sunday planned i also had a place in the big half in london booked so id get a half marathon in at race pace just before my tapering was scheduled by midfebruary i was on target for a time somewhere between 330 and 345

now here is where it went wrong at the beginning of march my longterm boyfriend broke up with me i was absolutely devastated from there on all training went out of the window i could not eat i could not sleep i lost a lot of weight and did absolutely no running for the entire month of march not even the half marathon race id paid for 

i was certain i wouldnt be running a marathon in april

but i decided that id paid £50 for this marathon id spent hours training already id been out in rain and snow and gale force winds  i was going to give it a good go my goal was to just finish the race no time in mind but i would forgive myself if i couldnt manage it because i certainly wasnt in condition for it

i began carbloading like mad and trying to get a few runs in just to stretch my legs out somewhat on april 1st i ran 4 miles at an 835 pace and my legs were dead after they were so sore and i considered giving up on the marathon there and then because if 4 miles was so painful how was i going to run another 22 on top of that 

i got another 4 miler in that week and then on the friday before the race i ran a decent and comfortable 10k and it was then that i decided to definitely try the marathon it meant i was going into the marathon with my longest run being just 17 miles well over a month ago

 prerace
i was driving up to manchester for the race with my parents which meant a 4am start i had a coffee and a toasted bagel with pb  banana in the car i also had a lucozade sport drink and another banana as we came into manchester 

at the starting pens i stretched out and did a good warmup for 45 minutes before official start time in my running belt i had 4 gels with gels along the course in mind as well two packs of clif energy bloks and a caffeine shot i was in pen e so my start time was about 920am

 race
i started out the race feeling great and the first 10miles seemed to fly by i felt good considering my lack of training and was enjoying myself 

by miles 1015 i settled into a good pace of about 845 id overtaken the 358 pacer and left them a while behind so i was feeling good by mile 15 i was starting to get a bit of a niggle in my knees so i slowed down slightly and had a gel i was also beginning to feel i may need the toilet soon as there had been ample water stations on route mile 18 came around  now into uncharted distances for me  and i was beginning to lag from here i kept telling myself get to the next mile then you can stop to walkuse a toilet the next mile would come around and id tell myself the same thing and so on 

at mile 22 the wheels well and truly came off energy wasnt an issue but my knees and hips were in agony with every step and so from here to mile 25 i would alter between running and walking for brief periods i knew at this point so close to the finish i couldnt drop out though the 358 pacer went by followed by the 400 pacer but i didnt care i was going to finish this race no matter the time 

in the last mile i ran  i sprinted somehow i found some reserves in me and with the finish line in sight i just wanted that torture over

 postrace
postrace i got my medal tshirt foil wrap etc and met my parents my mother was teary eyed which made me teary eyed i was just so proud of myself 


march was the worst month ive ever endured ive never felt so low and so i was thrilled to have ran and completed this marathon despite being told you cant wing a marathon i believe im evidence that you certainly can wing it but definitely should not

 training

the last half i ran was this race in 2018 i ran several 5ks and a 10k in between and have done several halfs prior to this one last year i road bike as well and do several long distance rides a year when i started running 45 years ago i trained using essentially the higdon method through a local group i dont run with the group anymore but that method typically dictates my training for the past year however ive been upping my session and weekly miles such that my short session runs were roughly 10k as opposed to a 34 mile short session in higdon in any event not having a half last fall helped with this slow increase it also allowed me to stay uninjured for a long time which due to middle age has been a problem in the past and there always seems to be some new nagging ailment around the corner

 prerace

i dont consider my self to be a diehard runner rather i see running as one of several things i do to try and stay in some semblance of shape i do like to improve against myself but im not out to break any records or drastically push the limits of my body in that vein prior to all my other halfs i did not do anything generally recommended relating to nutrition hydration or rest in the week or so leading up to the race this time was different primarily because i have another half scheduled in 8 weeks and i wanted to make sure that i left this race uninjured and in good enough condition to not miss too many days after to get back into training in fact mentally i was looking at this race as a longrun in my training for the next race in that regard i tapered in the two weeks leading up to the race hydrated until i was a bag of water carbo loaded with typically recommended foods in the days prior got good rest and most untypically for my prerace rituals refrained from alcohol for a few days prior i also completely changed my running playlist the day before the race adding tons of songs to the point that i didnt even know what was on it

 race

oklahoma at the end of april is typically rain forest level muggy and hot i have problems running in those conditions and in the week leading up to the race several inches of rain fell and race day was forecast at about 75 degrees and i feared the worst thankfully it was in the low 50s at race time with a bit of a cool breeze and it stayed cool past the point of me finishing 

close to 25000 people run this race and many of them are walkers my pace was a lot slower than i wanted for about the first 5 miles due to crowding and trying to navigate around large groups of walkers at about mile 5 it began to thin out and my pace increased i felt really good for the next several miles slowly overtaking person by person at about mile 85 i had to pee and lost several minutes in line waiting much to my frustration  i was feeling great and didnt want to loose momentum 

immediately after that was the famous gorilla hill part of the race which is the largest incline in the race i was feeling great and passed lots of people going up the hill after reaching the top under the new course this year we turned and started back down towards downtown okc the new course has far less turns through neighborhoods and is instead almost a straight shot back downtown with a final l i think this new course is faster and my pace was generally increasing throughout barring a small stretch of another long but moderate hill 

in the final couple miles i felt great and was running strong when i made the final turn i could see the finish line about a quarter mile away and gave a decent push such that i was still increasing speed as i crossed the line i wanted to finish under 230 all my other halfs have been right around 240 and knew i had a couple minutes to spare but wasnt going to take any chances 

 postrace

after crossing the line i felt great and was happy to have hit my goals as i thought about what lead me there i attributed it to 1 training 1 hydration 1 cool weather 1 carbo loading 1 rest and 95 changing my playlist which clearly had some sort of inrunmuscleconfusionpowerboost effect which caused my best half yet

 background
i was in no way athletic growing up sure i did a few sports here and there but i was overweight and obese during the vast majority of my teen years and adult life 
this posthttpswwwredditcomrfitnesscomments76izu714monthtransformationfromobesetofit actually i did on reddit summarizes my trip to getting fitish 
i ran during that period but then got into lifting and stopped 
however i loved that feeling of freedom when running and it was a matter of time before i get back to it 
a coworker suggests we run the paris half marathon in march 2018 and the passion with running is rekindled 
i ran the hm injured it band and pfps combined and had to walk the last 5k due to hypoglycemia it was a terrible experience but i learned a lot 
end of april 2018 i sign up to a 10k race for my return from injury and get a 4750 pr which got me back on track 
a friend of mine suggests we run paris full marathon next year and out of excitement i agree  

 training

as you might conclude from the background im in no way shape or form ready to tackle a marathon i no little to nothing about running i never ran more than a half marathon distance and my only half marathon race ended in disaster 2h20 chip time 
during the month of may i got back to running frequently as in 3 to 4 times a week but for distances shorter than 10k mostly i hop online ask for guidance realize im way off my target of sub 4 hours i then started rethinking my strategy realized i needed to build an aerobic base first and foremost learned about easy zone 2 runs basically i started to scratch the surface of what running was 
i looked up a few plans online and found a free aerobic base building plan that peaked around 7080km started applying it running went great and felt great by the month of november i had signed up for a half marathon and pred at 1h37 things were improving and looking good i dedicated the following weeks to an express 10k prep for a race mid december and although i did implode by km 7 i still managed a 4303 pr i took the last week of 2018 off and started mentally preparing to tackle the marathon plan first day of january 

the marathon plan i picked was designed for a bq but i figured its not an issue since i already used the same plan structure for aerobic base and my 10k it spans over 16 weeks with some decent volume peak 
i applied it as best as i could with a small tweak of my time goal in my mind i knew i had 3h30 in my legs i just needed to get it right 
training went smooth except for a period of 10 days end of january where a very bad cold hit me and left me with some asthma like condition in my chest id cough my lungs off whenever i stop running luckily 3 weeks after the condition dwindled away the funny thing is i still managed my long runs in that period one the day before i fell ill one a week after was a trail race i registered for and took super easy that helped reduce the impact 
after that it all really went super smooth and not a workout was skipped
yasso test maybe 6 weeks out yielded 315 average i was very pleased and reassured that i was doing is working 

training volume breakdown 
january 321 km
february 3435 km
march 5085 km 
2 weeks of april 122 km 
peak volume week 119 km  

 prerace
the week of the race i started worrying and stressing hard i felt anything could go wrong and the prep i had deserved a worthy finish with a good race performance 
race start is 3040 min away from home by subway i woke up around 530 nonetheless had a light breakfast consisting of black coffee bread crackers with jam and honey then hit the toilet 4 times 
got ready and left my place with a small bag to leave in check containing a jacket and i planned to put the joggers i was wearing over my shorts in it too 
weather conditions were perfect for running 0°c at the start and temps to get around 56°c by midday so i chose to go with a tshirt  short combo but with arm warmers and gloves which i knew ill be discarding 30 min in the race 
i arrive to champs elysées go to a coffee shop for another toilet break remove my joggers and start looking for the bag check which i couldnt find till very late i sprint for it then sprint back to get into my corral which was supposed to be closed by then but i managed to get in no time to stress already warm with my sprints we start moving forward to the start line  

 race
my race strategy has got to be the simplest that ever existed find the 3h30 pacer and cling to him with your life although i had headphones in my ears before the race i removed them and put them in my belt during the race i kept discussing with the cool pacer we had and some runners of our small group 
 kilometers 0 to 5
everything is going smooth except my garmin was already picking up extra distance at alarming rate by the 5k mark i had maybe 300m extra which wasnt ideal for pacing 
 kilometers 6 to 18
nothing special aid stations were chaos as usual with people cutting but i managed to smoothly pick up bottles i took a gel whenever i saw the aid station signal 
km 18 comes about as i was discussing with the pacer the effect of the 10k time on marathon times i was genuinely taken by surprise we were already there 
i also started seeing people dealing with cramps already yikes 
 kilometers 19 to 27
i managed to lose the pacer actually he found a friend and were falling behind i went forward for a bit and ended up clocking my 3 fastest kilometers of the race 
i knew i couldnt allow this to happen otherwise ill pay the price later so i decided to slow down by km 28 the pacer caught up with me 

 kilometers 28 to 39
by now my watch picked up 1 extra km which was annoying but whatever 
our tiny group was moving smooth i had a few belly complaints probably from a cold bottle i picked at an aid station before it was weirdly colder than the rest 
there was a hill in this part of the course the pacer led us through it easily 

 kilometers 39 to 42195
i had more than 1 min in the bank so i took it real easy i had walked to drink properly in the last aid station and the pacer group was 100m ahead of me 
the finish line is now in eyesight i take a look at the watch and realize i had 10 seconds to 3h30 so i get sprinting 
and boom its a wrap in 3h2954 
distance on watch was 43400m




 postrace
i immediately went to the pacer and thanked him deeply it wouldnt have been possible without his help 
then i started feeling my legs turning into noodles i picked up my bag from check after some zombie walking then found my friends who all had prs a colleague from work actually came by to see how i did which was super nice and my phone was ringing off the hook    
i then waited on a friend who was also running his first marathon and managed a 428 finish he had a 430 finish goal we then went to get pizza and celebrate the day

actually he found a friend and were falling behind i went forward for a bit and ended up clocking my 3 fastest kilometers of the race i knew i couldnt allow this to happen otherwise ill pay the price later so i decided to slow down by km 28 the pacer caught up with me  kilometers 28 to 39by now my watch picked up 1 extra km which was annoying but whatever our tiny group was moving smooth i had a few belly complaints probably from a cold bottle i picked at an aid station before it was weirdly colder than the rest there was a hill in this part of the course the pacer led us through it easily  kilometers 39 to 42195i had more than 1 min in the bank so i took it real easy i had walked to drink properly in the last aid station and the pacer group was 100m ahead of me the finish line is now in eyesight i take a look at the watch and realize i had 10 seconds to 3h30 so i get sprinting and boom its a wrap in 3h2954 distance on watch was 43400m postracei immediately went to the pacer and thanked him deeply it wouldnt have been possible without his help then i started feeling my legs turning into noodles i picked up my bag from check after some zombie walking then found my friends who all had prs a colleague from work actually came by to see how i did which was super nice and my phone was ringing off the hook    i then waited on a friend who was also running his first marathon and managed a 428 finish he had a 430 finish goal we then went to get pizza and celebrate the day   pictures me at the finish line stretchhttpsimgurcomje8pwsn me chugging water somewhere during the

 training
i started running 2 years ago at the time i could barely run half a mile i ran the 5000 yard dash in october of 2018 and thought that was going to be enough to feel accomplished turns out running is a hell of a drug and i immediately set my sights on doing broad street the following may at the time i didnt think i could possibly run 10 miles but wanted to give it a try

i started training in february and was running 3 timesweek i followed a pretty basic plan

 3  5 5 85

 7  5 3 

i ran the 10 mile run during training at 14500 and felt pretty good afterwards so that was my goal for the race

 prerace
i watched the forecast every day leading up to the weekend and it kept getting worse i was really not looking forward to running in the rain but when i woke up sunday it didnt seem too bad out my girlfriend dropped me off around 745 and i went to go find my corral pink all the way in the back i taped up my shoes and wore a poncho which helped keep me dry prior to the race

we waited around for about 45 minutes before starting to walk forward and then the race just started i was kind of surprised at how quickly we went from standing around to being out on the course the rocky music to start was awesome

 race
boy what an adrenaline rush i was not prepared for the amount of incredible support from folks on the sidewalk even in the rain im so glad i decided not to wear headphones primarily because of the rain this allowed me to really take in the moment and appreciate all the things i had heard people say about this race

there was definitely a fair amount of bobbing and weaving but it was kind of nice to have a bit of a slow down every once in awhile i stepped in more puddles than i would have liked so by the end my feet were soaked the rain actually felt pretty good during the race but once we stopped at the end it got really cold

the temple band all the random people playing music endless high fives and funny signs were all highlights which provided extra motivation to keep going

 postrace
the feeling crossing the finish line at the navy yard was one i will remember for the rest of my life what a rewarding feeling cant wait to do this race again next year hopefully

met up with some friends that were tailgating for the phillies game and had a few welldeserved hot dogs and beers

 training

i was coming off nearly a year of training for my firstever half marathon i followed a modified version of the hal higdon novice 2 for the first 7 weeks i was able to hold steady to my workout plan—so much so that i was raising naively my pace goals

the training is easy early on between late nights in the office working through weekends and getting hit with the polar vortex it was more and more difficult to find time to squeeze in a run some days i’d find myself running 6 slow miles in the treadmill before work 6 more while i had dinner slowly cooking in the oven and 6 more before bed

i found myself panicking the last few weeks leading up to the marathon because of how often i was skipping runs but regardless of the race results i was already enjoying being the lightest i’ve been since high school dropping nearly 55lbs over the course of the year

 prerace

despite the extra hours i was burning in the office 2 weeks before the race i was let go from my job but part of the reason i chose the milwaukee marathon was because it’s the city of my alma mater where i spent the first 5 years of my career before moving on so i came back to the good land a few days early to catch up with old colleagues over coffees and beers

somewhere between those glasses i should’ve mixed in a glass of water or two the day before my race i usually spend it drowning myself in water to keep my fluids up and the day before my biggest race i ignored it

 race  starting line

my brother and i showed up early as volunteers were getting to their stations and vendors were figuring out how to open their tents in the last few races we ran together we’re usually sweating from sprinting from gear check to bathrooms to hopping the fence at the starting gate for our first ever marathon we decided to get their early this gave us a chance to take photos with the costumed runners and soaking up all the positivity from all the other runners

we also showed up early enough for me to do my prerun ritual just before getting into our corral i’ve been told what i do is very sociopathic but i listen to a single catchy song that i hardly know the words to just before my run and then throughout the race i’ll repeat it over and over in my head until i’m essentially repeating the same 10 seconds weird i know but it gets me to a point where i can mentally escape almost like a meditation

 race  miles 16

i’m used to running by myself i didn’t have a training partner my brother hardly followed the plan i gave him and i couldn’t find my friends at the starting line and that meditation thing i mentioned it usually takes a couple miles before i’m in the zone

as we’re warming up through the streets of downtown—slowly cutting through water street and enjoying the nostalgia of my early years—my brother wants someone to talk to for the first couple mile markers he’d nudge me and ecstatically count down “woo only 25 miles to go”

 race  miles 7131

by now i’m starting to find my feet i told my brother to shut up about counting down the miles timing our pace or any talks about what it’s like hitting the wall and i made friends with one of bikeriding volunteers we joked about how she keeps changing the pace on us trading places and other cliches but it was nice talking to someone who was less hype and more encouragement

at this point the only thing annoying me was how full the water glasses at the hydration stations were it took multiple sips to get to a point where i could down it in one gulp while running i’d prefer to take multiple cups as i run through the station but instead i started pouring out half the water in each cup

we’re steps away from the alma mater where the half marathoners cut back for a final mile to the finish line and the marathoners run uphill through campus and through the north western suburbs and it seemed like nearly everyone i was with was a half marathoner as the crowd around me dissolved into just a handful of people

 race  miles 13119

milwaukee is the most segregated city in the us and marquette university is a jesuit institution built strategically in a poor neighborhood as a way to easily give aide to the needy in the surrounding community the first 131 miles of the course has run through downtown the east side the uppereast side and down milwaukee’s main street these are the areas shown on broll footage during gamecasts of brewers bucks and golden eagle games

the next 2 miles cut through the cracked sidewalks and potholed roads of a generouslyspeaking “upandcoming neighborhood” before coming across grassy parks and restoredmansions of wauwatosa

i’ve lived in multiple neighborhoods in milwaukee in my 9 years of living there and what drove the tiredness away from the early miles was my familiarity and nostalgia winding around through these neighborhoods felt less like welcoming an old friend and a bit more like meeting a stranger from the same city miles away from home and he doesn’t share the same romantic memories as you

the unfamiliarity made every mile seem longer than necessary and each turn made you think “hey this is where we turn back toward the place we used to know” but alas it every marker seemed to be stretched further and further on

 race  miles 19262

i was alone now with the smaller crowds of runners came smaller crowds of encouragement fewer spectators stood to the side and the runners alongside me were either way ahead of me or way behind me my brother had to walk somewhere around 17 but i was going to run my race but “run” is questionable at this point

at mile 20 i was down to my last pack of clif blocks and i needed any energy i could get my hands on at this point i was following a general strategy of eating 2 every 2 miles with how much i was trudging along i took them all at the next water station beyond this is nomans land i’ve never run more than 20 miles and that 20 was hard fought there’s only 6 in front of me and i’ve done more than 3 times that thus far

mile 22 i saw my dad for the second time on the route he was cheering me on jogging along side of me with a phone in my face trying to facetime with family from all over it was a mix of emotions from “hey get that thing out of my face” to “i’m really glad to see all of you right now”

mile 23 was the last time i saw my cycling friend she spouted words of encouragement told me how far back my brother was and that i’ve been running a great race i repeated those last words over and over to try to keep me going even after she left to check on other runners

but it was too little too late i hit the wall my feet were braking more than they were propelling me forward my back was hunched my arms swung wildly my legs felt wooden and in my head i could only hear myself say “a little walking wouldn’t hurt anyone”

steps away from running back again through marquette and i stopped i took a deep breath and then walked

first one of the costumed characters passed me then a friend stopped to chat before he continued on then the 410 pacers then the 420 pacers then the 430 pacers i wanted to cry all these weeks of training had led up to this point and i let myself down spectators continued to cheer and yell words of encouragement as i strolled by and the two times i tried to get up and running again my legs were too cramped a vice gripped my calves and quads and held me down to the ground and pulled me into quick sand struggling only seemed to make things worse

as i rounded the corner to the last 2—the straightaway to the finish line—i decided that the last few miles were behind me and this wasn’t going to be how it was going to end i started with a frankensteinlike hobble i allowed my knees to break and i was swinging my hips to get my legs to move forward i felt like i was kicking a final sprint and looked more like a grandpa treading carefully down a gently sloping driveway to collect the mail well grandpa i traveled a long way that day—i didn’t hit any of my goals but my original—and after 435 i delivered

 background
before i go into this we need to take a quick trip back to 2013 in 2013 i was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease in my eye that very likely could have made me blind im a filmmaker so this was devastating news however through the amazing work at mass eye and ear i was able to keep my vision and continue to make films last summer i got the news that i was nearing the end of my treatment and i wanted to find a way to give back so i decided to run the boston marathon my sister also decided to join me and help raise funds for medical research on my disease as well previously i had only run 10ks but i figured the goal wasnt to win it was to finish so thats what i started working on i know a lot of people frown upon the charity runners but im really glad i did my first marathon with them because they gave me access to a training program that i could modify with the intense medication i still need to take for my eyes i knew from the very beginning that i wasnt going to be fast but if i knew it was possible for us to keep a steady pace of a 13minute mile

im not sure where to fit this in but i had the advantage of living along the route so i was able to do all my training along the route it got to the point in my training where i could do heartbreak hill in my sleep my longest run was 192 miles about 3 weeks ago i decided to give myself a longer taper because ive been having problems with my it band and focused more on nonimpact cardio

 prerace
i woke up around 4 am too excited to sleep any longer ive watched the boston marathon run past my house for 27 years and i was so excited to finally be a part of it plus it was downpouring with thunder and lightning so i was a tad worried about what the rest of the day was going to bring i tossed and turned until 6 am when i finally got up got dressed and had my dad drop me off at the start before the roads closed at 7 am my sister and i knew it was too early to start getting fully ready so we watched dawn wall on netflix for some motivation while we ate a bagel and waited for the rest of the team we started doing some yoga and a ton of foam rolling around 9 am and stopped around 1015 when we went outside to take some group photos and started to make our way into the corrals due to the possibility of really bad weather like last year the baa moved wave 4 into a rolling start directly after wave 3 which in the long run probably didnt work in our favor

 race
ill be the first to say it i got caught up in the excitement and emotion and went out way too fast for the first mile but i had done it before in previous training sessions so i figured id lose some time a little bit later down the road but it was all good im so glad i was able to start with my sister at first we were worried that wed be in different corrals but due to the rolling start we were next to each other the whole time we also kept each others emotions in check apparently we also made the news crossing over the start line we didnt see any of our squad until around the 4k mark aka our street it was really awesome running past our parents aunts and uncles and neighbors i work for ashland cable as well so once we hit downtown ashland we had to stop for a quick interview with the news team as well but i used it as a moment to recover from our quick first mile by this point the weather was good it was still cool and cloudy but as soon as we hit downtown framingham things started to change

framingham to newton is a bit of a blur i started to get very overheated between framingham and natick which started to make me very sick to my stomach at first it was okay we just took a few more walk breaks however once we hit natick we started to see more of our squad which was extremely motivational until we saw our old babysitter who flew out from colorado we had to stop and walk at that point because my sister and i were both crying did i mention it was an extremely emotional day but we quickly pulled ourselves together dropped off more clothing with our parents we decided we didnt need our rain jackets anymore and ran through downtown natick both my parents grew up in natick so it was really cool to run through the town with a ton of people holding up signs for us from there it was just a push through the hot steamy sun to try to make it to the finish i knew we were a little bit off target from previous training runs but i still had hope that once it started to rain wed be able to pick up the pace and get back on target

running through wellesley college was very cool most of the students had gone inside by the time we got to them i think it was around 230 pm but there was still enough that it made me fill up with tears again it was amazing to run through with everyone calling my sisters and is name downtown wellesley and the hill up to newton wellesley hospital was pretty miserable we did spend a good portion of that time with a fellow mass eye and ear team member so that made it more enjoyable the clouds were starting to roll in but it was still hot and a bad crosswind was coming across the highway but it didnt last long i was so overheated at this point i took my hat off and started to have a little pity party for myself i was miserable and was very close to quitting but my sister became my own personal cheerleader telling me that ive trained for this and that i can do it and we are almost there and then it started to rain and everything started to be okay again it was perfect timing i dont think i could have gone up those hills in the sun

mass eye and ear had a big cheering section at mile 19 our parents were there but a little less enthusiastic because it was raining i could also tell that my mother was really upset i later learned she was just very worried about us but we stopped for a moment grabbed a granola bar and i tried to eat it without throwing up i did then we started to make our way up the hills my it band was holding up really well but my sisters wasnt so we decided to walk up the hill and run down the other side it worked pretty well our cousin met us halfway up one of the hills and cheered us on we also met a very nice man who was also going at a similar pace and we stuck with him throughout the hills as well it was really cool getting to talk to all the different people im pretty sure i stopped paying attention once we finished the hills i remember various snippets up until the final few miles i honestly think it was because i had run that section so much nothing visually was new hahaha

once we hit boston and could see the citgo sign i knew we were okay we were going to make it we had missed our 5hour goal but it was okay the overall goal was to just finish yes we were doing this to check it off our bucket list but also to raise money for a disease that doesnt affect young people and i really want to know more about why i have it and make sure im cured forever turning that final corner was the best and longest part of the race we had a ton of friends and family waiting for us my doctor even came to watch us with her children my mother sweet talked a police officer into letting her stand right behind the finish line and she and my father were waiting for us as soon as we crossed which also was shown on the news im a little bummed that we were a little over an hour off our goal but its okay the goal was to finish and thats what we did

 postrace
i knew it was going to be an extremely emotional day but i never could have finished it without my sister im extremely glad she decided to do it with me and that this is something that we will remember forever im sore and have an upset stomach but my it band held up and didnt bother me once stairs are my arch nemesis right now and i have a sunburn i should probably stretch more but i decided not throwing up is probably a better move and have spent the day asleep but overall it was an amazing experience and i wouldnt change a single thing

 whats next
i think im going to stick to shorter races for the next year or so and see if i can pr a few currently i have some 10ks and half marathons lined up both in the boston area and disney im thinking about doing the sugarloaf marathon in maine next may as well either way this wasnt my final boston im not sure ill ever be fast enough to bq but i will forever be in mass eye and ears debt so raising a few thousand dollars is a small price to pay for my vision and keeping my dream alive of being a filmmaker

quick trip back to 2013 in 2013 i was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease in my eye that very likely could have made me blind im a filmmaker so this was devastating news however through the amazing work at mass eye and ear i was able to keep my vision and continue to make films last summer i got the news that i was nearing the end of my treatment and i wanted to find a way to give back so i decided to run the boston marathon my sister also decided to join me and help raise funds for medical research on my disease as well previously i had only run 10ks but i figured the goal wasnt to win it was to finish so thats what i started working on i know a lot of people frown upon the charity runners but im really glad i did my first marathon with them because they gave me access to a training program that i could modify with the intense medication i still need to take for my eyes i knew from the very beginning that i wasnt going to be fast but if i knew it was possible for us to keep a steady pace of a 13minute mileim not sure where to fit this in but i had the advantage of living along the route so i was able to do all my training along the route it got to the point in my training where i could do heartbreak hill in my sleep my longest run was 192 miles about 3 weeks ago i decided to give myself a longer taper because ive been having problems with my it band and focused more on nonimpact cardio preracei woke up around 4 am too excited to sleep any longer ive watched the boston marathon run past my house for 27 years and i was so excited to finally be a part of it plus it was downpouring with thunder and lightning so i was a tad worried about what the rest of the day was going to bring i tossed and turned until 6 am when i finally got up got dressed and had my dad drop me off at the start before the roads closed at 7 am my sister and i knew it was too early to start getting fully ready so we watched dawn wall on netflix for some motivation while we ate a bagel and waited for the rest of the team we started doing some yoga and a ton of foam rolling around 9 am and stopped around 1015 when we went outside to take some group photos and started to make our way into the corrals due to the possibility of really bad weather like last year the baa moved wave 4 into a rolling start directly after wave 3 which in the long run probably didnt work in our favor raceill be the first to say it i got caught up in the excitement and emotion and went out way too fast for the first mile but i had done it before in previous training sessions so i figured id lose some time a little bit later down the road but it was all good im so glad i was able to start with my sister at first we were worried that wed be in different corrals but due to the rolling start we were next to each other the whole time we also kept each others emotions in check apparently we also made the news crossing over the start line we didnt see any of our squad until around the 4k mark aka our street it was really awesome running past our parents aunts and uncles and neighbors i work for ashland cable as well so once we hit downtown ashland we had to stop for a quick interview with the news team as well but i used it as a moment to recover from our quick first mile by this point the weather was good it was still cool and cloudy but as soon as we hit downtown framingham things started to changeframingham to newton is a bit of a blur i started to get very overheated between framingham and natick which started to make me very sick to my stomach at first it was okay we just took a few more walk breaks however once we hit natick we started to see more of our squad which was extremely motivational until we saw our old babysitter who flew out from colorado we had to stop and walk at that point because my sister and i were both crying did i mention it was an extremely emotional day but we quickly pulled ourselves together dropped off more clothing with our parents we decided we didnt need our rain jackets anymore and ran through downtown natick both my parents grew up in natick so it was really cool to run through the town with a ton of people holding up signs for us from there it was just a push through the hot steamy sun to try to make it to the finish i knew we were a little bit off target from previous training runs but i still had hope that once it started to rain wed be able to pick up the pace and get back on targetrunning through wellesley college was very cool most of the students had gone inside by the time we got to them i think it was around 230 pm but there was still enough that it made me fill up with tears again it was amazing to run through with everyone calling my sisters and is name downtown wellesley and the hill up to newton wellesley hospital was pretty miserable we did spend a good portion of that time with a fellow mass eye and ear team member so that made it more enjoyable the clouds were starting to roll in but it was still hot and a bad crosswind was coming across the highway but it didnt last long i was so overheated at this point i took my hat off and started to have a little pity party for myself i was miserable and was very close to quitting but my sister became my own personal cheerleader telling me that ive trained for this and that i can do it and we are almost there and then it started to rain and everything started to be okay again it was perfect timing i dont think i could have gone up those hills in the sunmass eye and ear had a big cheering section at mile 19 our parents were there but a little less

to eat it without throwing up i did then we started to make our way up the hills my it band was holding up really well but my sisters wasnt so we decided to walk up the hill and run down the other side it worked pretty well our cousin met us halfway up one of the hills and cheered us on we also met a very nice man who was also going at a similar pace and we stuck with him throughout the hills as well it was really cool getting to talk to all the different people im pretty sure i stopped paying attention once we finished the hills i remember various snippets up until the final few miles i honestly think it was because i had run that section so much nothing visually was new hahahaonce we hit boston and could see the citgo sign i knew we were okay we were going to make it we had missed

really want to know more about why i have it and make sure im cured forever turning that final corner was the best and longest part of the race we had a ton of friends and family waiting for us my doctor even came to watch us with her children my mother sweet talked a police officer into letting her stand right behind the finish line and she and my father were waiting for us as soon as we crossed which also was shown on the news im a little bummed that we were a little over an hour off our goal but its okay the goal was to finish and thats what we did postracei knew it was going to be

 training
in short my training was bad i was in great shape after running a 50k in early january but soon after i tweaked my achilles and had to take some time off when i tried to get back to running i got the start of a stress reaction in my upper tibia and had to stop again all in all i barely ran for the 68 weeks leading up to this race i did daily strength and mobility exercises as well as stretching and massage but this was probably the most unprepared i’ve ever been for a long race

 prerace
i went to bed later than i had hoped around 10 and woke up before my alarm went off at 440 while i prepped my gear i ate a bean and rice burrito mixed up some summit tea and had a bowl of cereal at 530 i drove up to mohican arriving at 645am i checked in and got my packet which included a bib tech tee and a “performance trucker hat” which is super cool i dropped my bag by the startfinish aid station and attended a brief prerace meeting before we all walked across the road to the start it was a beautiful morning with temps around 50ºf 10ºc for the first loop i wore a tshirt shorts calf sleeves light jacket hat hydration vest and a handheld

 race

 first loop
the race started with a loop around a campground and then across a narrow footbridge and into some steep hills the first 4 miles were pretty hilly as we went over a ridge and onto the rim trail everyone stayed pretty close through the first few miles so i just ran with people who looked like they knew what they were doing and did what they did around 5 km into the race we got to big ass hill and i started the long climb to the top i was still feeling okay after the first climb and went past the first aid station at the fire tower without stopping since i still had plenty of water with me after 2 miles of fairly easy trail i got to the covered bridge aid station and ate some chips while my handheld got filled with gatorade and water

after covered bridge i started on the 5ish mile dam loop which we only had to run on the first loop of the race i got to the dam and climbed the stairs to the top still running with a group of 810 people after the dam we ran past lyons falls and up more stairs the trail followed a small stream and at one point there was a sharp turn up a hill the course was marked with pink flags and we didn’t see them behind the trees and so the whole group i was with started following some property markers that had pink ribbons on them we bushwhacked through the woods for about half a mile while commenting how difficult the race organizers had made this section we realized we’d gone the wrong way and had to go back and ended up adding about a mile onto the run once we found the trail again i kept to a pretty easy pace since i was running low on fluids and eventually we returned to the covered bridge where i had more chips and pickles the rest of the first loop was easy trail through campgrounds and along the river followed by a trek back up the rim trail and over the hills back to the startfinish by the time i got back to the startfinish i was feeling really tired my legs were beat up from the climbs and i was getting dehydrated from being dressed too warmly at the turnaround i ditched my jacked and hat and grabbed my poles and sunglasses i set out on the second loop after eating some chex mix and getting the rocks out of my shoes

 second loop
the second loop went downhill quickly figuratively as i went up to the rim trail i was still figuring out how to best use my poles but they were definitely helping on the climbs around mile 22 i started to bonk hard i walked most of the totally runnable pavement leading to big ass hill and dragged myself to the top my stomach hurt my calves and quads were cramping up my lower back and neck hurt and my shoulders were getting sore from using the poles the trail through the woods was totally runnable but i ended up walking almost the whole 2 miles after the hills eventually i got back to the fire tower aid station where i sat under a tree for a few minutes and regrouped i ate some bacon grilled cheese pickles gingerale and took a salt pill and decided even if i had to walk the whole way i could make it to the finish with plenty of time before the cutoff as i started down the trail from the aid station something amazing happened i felt like i could run again i tried a jog and then a run and felt good enough that i ended up hauling ass to the covered bridge aid station 2 miles i felt amazing i’d hit the wall and i pushed through it and now i was going to enjoy the rest of the race at covered bridge i had more chips and a grilled peanut butter sandwich and a freezer pop the second time around we didn’t do the dam loop so i knew that the next 4 miles were pretty flat i opened up my stride a bit on the paved campground road and hit the trail i alternated running and walking whenever i felt like it and generally felt decent all the way back to the rim trail i was able to hike to the top without too much difficulty and ranwalked back down to the bottom where i took a picture of a deer skeleton that was on the course thankfully the course skipped the hills leading to the campground and instead went around a pond and up a short uphill to the finish where i crossed the line in just over 7 hours

 postrace
immediately after finishing i removed my hydration vest and lay down in the grass and had some beer there was really good beer at the finish my legs were cramping up like crazy but didn’t feel too terrible otherwise and i was feeling great just relaxing in the sun i walked to my car and swapped my race gear with shower stuff and then took a long shower at the campground pool house by the finish postrace there were burritos and bowls for participants and i picked at some food while feeling really bad i’d gotten super dehydrated and thankfully another columbus runner came over and got me some more water and gingerale which really helped i ate more of my burrito bowl i finally felt a bit better and then trekked back up the hill to my car and drove home

 postpostrace
i spent the rest of the day eating an entire large pizza and sleeping on the couch the following morning i had a 9mile race but i bailed and ran the 5k instead because my legs were so sore a few days later i’m feeling mostly recovered besides some persistent soreness in my feet and ankles

 final thoughts
forget the pr was a fantastic race the trails were beautiful volunteers were super helpful and supportive the aid stations were wellstocked and there was beer at the finish i definitely want to come back to mohican and run the trails more this summer and i would definitely recommend this race to anyone looking for a challenging ultra

the top still running with a group of 810 people after the dam we ran past lyons falls and up more stairs the trail followed a small stream and at one point there was a sharp turn up a hill the course was marked with pink flags and we didn’t see them behind the trees and so the whole group i was with started following some property markers that had pink ribbons on them we bushwhacked through the woods for about half a mile while commenting how difficult the race organizers had made this section we realized we’d gone the wrong way and had to go back and ended up adding about a mile onto the run once we found the trail again i kept to a pretty easy pace since i was running low on fluids and eventually we returned to the covered bridge where i had more chips and pickles the rest of the first loop was easy trail through campgrounds and along the river followed by a trek back up the rim trail and over the hills back to the startfinish by the time i got back to the startfinish i was

totally runnable but i ended up walking almost the whole 2 miles after the hills eventually i got back to the fire tower aid station where i sat under a tree for a few minutes and regrouped i ate some bacon grilled cheese pickles gingerale and took a salt pill and decided even if i had to walk the whole way i could make it to the finish with plenty of time before the cutoff as i started down the trail from the aid station something amazing happened i felt like i could run again i tried a jog and then a run and felt good enough that i ended up hauling ass to the covered bridge aid station 2 miles i felt amazing i’d hit the wall and i pushed through it and now i was going to enjoy the rest of the race at covered bridge i had more chips and a grilled peanut butter sandwich and a freezer pop the second time around we didn’t do the dam loop so i knew that the next 4 miles were pretty flat i opened up my stride a bit on the paved campground road and hit the trail i alternated running and walking whenever i felt like it and generally felt decent all the way back to the rim trail i was able to hike to the top without too much difficulty and ranwalked back down to the bottom where i

 training
ive got a run streak going so training mostly consisted of running every day with longer runs on weekends race day was 2298 not nearly enough hill training  i did 3 long runs of 30 miles  typical training weeks were 4050 miles with a peak of 60 

 race strategy
this race was much more hilly than my previous 100 mile and 24 hour race  8 laps of 1000 feet of elevation gain each  i was worried that this would slow me down a lot  my previous times were 2102 and 1900 during the 24 hour race so i figured this race would be significantly slower

i planned 2 changes of clothes with some backup rain gear and cold gear just in case 

see here for packing listhttpsiimgurcompofgjejpng and photoshttpsiimgurcome8cx0cfjpg 

my girlfriend j would be my primary crew lead with others stopping by throughout the day  shes amazing

gu every 5 miles salt tab every 10 miles stop at every aid station to at least eat something  sip of water at least every mile  for each lap my crew had a bag of gu and salt to take for the next lap  i also took a pack of gu chews  stingers alternating each lap which was a nice variety

our flight home after the race was originally 730am 26 hours into the race so i knew id have to finish by 24 hours to make that  that was making me a little nervous so i was able to change the flight to 1030am  we ended up not needing that extra time at all  just another thing to worry about


 prerace
flew into raleigh the day before and we could see the park as we landed  did some snack shopping then went to the park for bib pickup and briefing around 5pm  honestly this was a mess  it rained all day friday so the park was very muddy  the briefing was a crowded mess of announcements  we left 30 minutes into it since it didnt seem like there was any meaningful information  

thankfully a race volunteer was able to answer all of our questions as we were leaving

met up with our friend n who would join us for half a day of crewing  got some pasta x2 at maggianos on friday evening then called it an early night around 8pm


 race day
woke up around 430am quickly got ready and out the door by 5am  after a slow drive through the park and finding parking got to the start line just after 530am  stood in line for the restroom and barely got to the start line in time for the starting horn  this was a very hectic experience

 miles 1 to 25

and were off the first 2 miles were pretty crowded and still dark so many runners had headlamps  i did not i just stuck with other runners for the first 40 minutes until the sun came up  got to the first aid station at mile 7 grabbed some fruit and headed off  the back half of the course was much tougher in elevation gain than the first half but a bit shorter
i ran the entirety of the course for the first lap which felt great  these hills cant beat me  passed the cool critter log near mile 95  something to look forward to each lap after the big hills

finished lap 1 in just under 2 hours

refilled water at the start then headed out for lap 2  now i knew the territory and it wasnt so bad this lap also flew by but i did start walking up some of the tougher hills  stopped at the aid station for more fruit then finished the second half of the course one of the volunteers told me that i was in the top 10 which i dont think i wanted to know  ate some chikfila at the start line courtesy of my awesome crew  one more lap until a fresh set of clothes and shoes

finished lap 2 around 2 hours  being able to have 2 laps done in under 4 hours made me feel great i like crunching the numbers in my head  if i wanted to make 24 hours i needed to run the next 6 laps in 20 hours  easy peasy


 miles 26 to 50
kept moving for lap 3 but more walking on the hills  i was starting to get a feel for the rhythm of the course  mile 4 felt completely uphill but 57 were a nice downhill rolling into the aid station  795 were the worst hills but not impossible

changed clothes after lap 3 mile 375
lap 4 felt really nice in a new change of clothes  i started using my headphones this lap which was a nice change of pace from the first 3 laps  listened to some  car talk podcasts this lap  i also started to put ice in my hat at aid stations as the temperature was warming up  i love that feeling

this lap is where i noticed i was actually starting to lap people and getting lapped  with 300 runners on the 125 mile course it was sometimes hard to tell who was passing who since runners would speed up and slow down according to their own rhythm

some friends from work showed up as i crossed the start line at mile 50  now i had a great cheering section of 4 people  stuffed my face with a hot dog and hamburger then moved out
i think this was at the end of lap 4httpsiimgurcom33fbev6jpg

 miles 51 to 75

lap 5 was smooth sailing  continued to listen to podcasts this lap  i was really starting to hate the hill from mile 45  it felt like it was uphill the entire mile  however miles 57 were a nice rolling downhill leading right up to the aid station  every step on this lap was a good feeling  i was more than halfway home i called 2 of my sisters on the hills of the back half of lap 5  great encouragement  the rest of my crew had to leave at this point so i said bye to everyone  just j and i left

i brought my headlamp to start lap 6 since i didnt think id make it back before sunset good call  i left my headphones at the start line to charge so id have them 100 for the last 2 laps  
i was walking more now and more running portions were slowing down significantly but i was still moving forward
there is no race theres only a runner  you just put one foot in front of the other
ate some pizza at the halfway aid station  called my parents on the back hills to talk me through it
it started to get dark during the end of lap 6 and i was really glad i had my headlamp for the last 2 miles
changed clothes again at the end of lap 6

 miles 76 to 100
only 2 more laps to go  i wore a jacket for the last 2 laps which i probably didnt need but kept just in case of the wind

called another one of my sisters on the hills of lap 7  she got me to keep it moving

lap 8 last lap last lap last lap
grabbed a fun glow stick  this a fun identifier for people on their last lap  everyone who saw me wished me luck on the final time through 

 starting the last laphttpsiimgurcomgj4ncogjpg 

saw a shooting star about a mile into this lap which put me in a really good mood  passed my friend louise again she was on lap 6 and moving well  all throughout this lap i was saying goodbye to portions of the course  climbing the mile 4 hill for the last time was a great feeling  i passed midnight at some point early on this lap so i made sure to run 1 whole mile for sundays run streak goal mile 9192 it was slow but i did it

listened to the book of mormon soundtrack for the first half of this lap then switched back to my workout music  thanked the wonderful aid station volunteers as i passed through mile 7 93 for the last time around 1am  they were amazing every lap  good music carried me through the last bad hills  my headphones died so i started playing music while my phone was held in my camelback pocket  hope no one minded  i was almost in tears as i passed by the mile 12 995 marker  took that emotion and powered through to the finish line

 postrace
20 gus 10 salt tabs 3 pairs of shoes a few hot dogs hamburgers slices of pizza and 100 miles later it felt great to be done  crossed the finish line just after 230am official time of 203211 earning a sub24 hour belt buckle  i took off some of my gear and knelt down  i didnt think the race officials caught my bib number so i walked back over to show them and someone mentioned that i had 1 more lap to go  i almost passed out but they quickly realized that i had indeed done 8 laps and handed over the belt buckle  later in the week i saw the official results had me at 26th overall 1st place in my age group

quickly headed to the car so we could get out of the park at the 3am gate opening
this might have been my least favorite thing about the race  overnight the park gate is only opened for 15 minutes every hour on the hour  so if you finish at 3am and it takes 15 minutes to drive out of the park youd be stuck at the gate for 45 minutes until the ranger opens the gates that is nuts  i know this is a state park and they control access but there has got to be a better way to handle this  i guess this was good motivation to finish faster but its not really something i want to think about while running an ultra  hope im able to leave when im done

j and i were able to go on standby for a 530am flight so we quickly went back to the hotel showered headed to the airport and got lucky enough to get on the flight  i find it hard to sleep right after an ultra so a few mimosas were just what i needed  got back to our apartment by 8am and then i was able to go lights out


 reflections
because of the elevation gain i wasnt sure how realistic my goal of 2022 hours was  however i was able to stick to my nutrition plan not crash too hard and finish strong

i liked that each lap was 125 miles instead of an even number  this led to each lap my watch miles ticking off slightly differently from the mile markers on the course  made each lap feel different

i also liked that i had milestones to look forward to as i was running  3 laps finished meant a change of clothes 4 was halfway 6 was another change of clothes etc  made each section feel much more bearable

i really enjoyed having a great crew on site and being able to call my family later in the evening on the tough hills

and especially thankful for my alwayscrew lead j  couldnt do this without you there

note to self dont book flights for right after an ultra while the timing worked out really well in this case and we got lucky with standby seats the extra stress isnt helpful  if were doing a destination race id much rather fly back either later in the day or even a few days later

this was tough to write as it all kind of blurred together  i shouldve started writing right after the race instead of waiting a few days

 whats next
not sure  this was my first race to qualify for western states 100 so ill definitely try entering that lottery later this year 
50k on april 20th thatll be a good chance to make sure the legs are still functioning

runs on weekends race day was 2298 not nearly enough hill training  i did 3 long runs of 30 miles  typical training weeks were 4050 miles with a peak of 60  race strategythis race was much more hilly than my previous 100 mile and 24 hour race  8 laps of 1000 feet of elevation gain each  i was worried that this would slow me down a lot  my previous times were 2102 and 1900 during the 24 hour race so i figured this race would be significantly sloweri planned 2 changes of clothes with some backup rain gear and cold gear just in case see here for packing listhttpsiimgurcompofgjejpng and photoshttpsiimgurcome8cx0cfjpg my girlfriend j would be my primary crew lead with others stopping by throughout the day  shes amazinggu every 5 miles salt tab every 10 miles stop at every aid station to at least eat something  sip of water at least every mile  for each lap my crew had a bag of gu and salt to take for the next lap  i also took a pack of gu chews  stingers alternating each lap which was a nice varietyour flight home after the race was originally 730am 26 hours into the race so i knew id have to finish by 24 hours to make that  that was making me a little nervous so i was able to change the flight to 1030am  we ended up not needing that extra time at all  just another thing to worry about preraceflew into raleigh the day before and we could see the park as we landed  did some snack shopping then went to the park for bib pickup and briefing around 5pm  honestly this was a mess  it rained all day friday so the park was very muddy  the briefing was a crowded mess of announcements  we left 30 minutes into it since it didnt seem like there was any meaningful information  thankfully a race volunteer was able to answer all of our questions as we were leavingmet up with our friend n who would join us for half a day of crewing  got some pasta x2 at maggianos on friday evening then called it an early night around 8pm race daywoke up around 430am quickly got ready and out the door by 5am  after a slow drive through the park and finding parking got to the start line just after 530am  stood in line for the restroom and barely got to the start line in time for the starting horn  this was a very hectic experience miles 1 to 25and were off the first 2 miles were pretty crowded and still dark so many runners had headlamps  i did not i just stuck with other runners for the first 40 minutes until the sun came up  got to the first aid station at mile 7 grabbed some fruit and headed off  the back half of the course was much tougher in elevation gain than the first half but a bit shorteri ran the entirety of the course for the first lap which felt great  these hills cant beat me  passed the cool critter log near mile 95  something to look forward to each lap after the big hillsfinished lap 1 in just under 2 hoursrefilled water at the start then headed out for lap 2  now i knew the territory and it wasnt so bad this lap also flew by but i did start walking up some of the tougher hills  stopped at the aid station for more fruit then finished the second half of the course one of the volunteers told me that i was in the top 10 which i dont think i wanted to know  ate some chikfila at the start line courtesy of my awesome crew  one more lap until a fresh set of clothes and shoesfinished lap 2 around 2 hours  being able to have 2 laps done in under 4 hours made me feel great i like crunching the numbers in my head  if i wanted to make 24 hours i needed to run the next 6 laps in 20 hours  easy peasy miles 26 to 50kept moving for lap 3 but more walking on the hills  i was starting to get a feel for the rhythm of the course  mile 4 felt completely uphill but 57 were a nice downhill rolling into the aid station  795 were the worst hills but not impossiblechanged clothes after lap 3 mile 375lap 4 felt really nice in a new change of clothes  i started using my headphones this lap which was a nice change of pace from the first 3 laps  listened to some  car talk podcasts this lap  i also started to put ice in my hat at aid stations as the temperature was warming up  i love that feelingthis lap is where i noticed i was actually starting to lap people and getting lapped  with 300 runners on the 125 mile course it was sometimes hard to tell who was passing who since runners would speed up and slow down according to their own rhythmsome friends from work showed up as i crossed the start line at mile 50  now i had a great cheering section of 4 people  stuffed my face with a hot dog and hamburger then moved outi think this was at the end of lap 4httpsiimgurcom33fbev6jpg miles 51 to 75lap 5 was smooth sailing  continued to listen to podcasts this lap  i was really starting to hate the hill from mile 45  it felt like it was uphill the entire mile  however miles 57 were a nice rolling downhill leading right up to the aid station  every step on this lap was a good feeling  i was more than halfway home i called 2 of my sisters on the hills of the back half of lap 5  great encouragement  the rest of my crew had to leave at this point so i said bye to everyone  just j and i lefti brought my headlamp to start lap 6 since i didnt think id make it back before sunset good call  i left my headphones at the start line to charge so id have them 100 for the last 2 laps  i was walking more now and more running portions were slowing down significantly but i was still moving forwardthere is no race theres only a runner  you just put one foot in front of the otherate some pizza at the halfway aid station  called my

 background  training

years ago i was an average high school cross country and track athlete who burned out on running hard after four years of really intense training ten years after graduating high school i had gained 45 pounds and found myself really unhappy with how i felt physically for some reason after ten years of little or no running i felt a really strong urge to train and especially to race again i missed that feeling of competing with myself and seeing what i was capable of so in november of 2018 i decided to get back in shape  i started running 3x a week usually 23 miles with a very minimal speedwork thrown in

in january i signed up for the philadelphia broad street run 10miler in may and started hal higdons novice 15k plan most of my runs were done at 1130mi pace once a week i would throw in a 2mile tempo or a few surges around 910920mi pace very early on i decided that i wanted to race a 5k during one of the programs backoff weeks just to test myself and for a little extra focus and motivation during training i wasnt planning to do any 5kspecific training just see what i could do from all the easy miles and that minimal speedwork the day i signed up i set a goal of sub30 my training went well and i knew that i could run faster than 30 minutes sub29 felt achievable and sub28 was not out of the realm of possibility

 prerace

it ended up being a beautiful day for a 5k around 55 degrees and breezy right by the beach i was very anxious before the race  the last time i trained for and ran a 5k was in 2007 and i was in much better shape i did a quick warmup along the first mile of the course watched the kids on the mile fun run before the 5k and lined up for my race

 race

my plan was to go out steady and cut the pace down through the second half of the race in my high school 5k races i often went out way too fast and died around the halfway mark this was really tough to do people were blowing by me in the first half mile but around the 1 mile mark it felt like everyone around me slowed down and i started passing people left and right most of the second mile was along the boardwalk which was just an awesome atmosphere to race in and had me in a really positive mood by the third mile i was definitely feeling the pain but i kept thinking to myself if i can hang onto this pace i will end up running a great time i came through the finish in 2803 with the third mile being the fastest of the bunch and the fastest mile ive run in a while

 postrace

im very happy with the result even though its almost ten minutes slower than my 5k pr from high school

i read this subreddit a lot over the last few months and one thing that i think really helped me was keeping most of my training runs easy back in the day my training consisted of a ton of track work and intensely competitive training runs honestly going into the race this probably increased my nerves  my goal pace was much faster and farther than anything i had done in training but in the end it worked out fantastically so to all the commenters here constantly hounding people to keep the easy days easy thank you i did and it worked out well

back when i started in november i set a goal to run sub25min for the 5k in 2019 i have a long way to go to achieve that goal  i have at least 20 more pounds to lose i havent done any track workouts or speedwork of any kind and there is room to add more days of running and more miles but im really encouraged by this result very excited to get back into training for the 10miler in may

thanks for reading

 training
so while a sub 50 10k probably isnt that exciting for a lot of people for me this has been huge 7 months ago i was a brand new first time mum of a 9lb baby struggling with learning to breastfeed crazy sleep deprivation and the exquisite agony that is a fractured tailbone as a result of the birth sitting was agony standing up was agony the idea of getting back to running was a pipe dream but i set a goal to run another halfmarathon this year and ive been slowly but surely plugging away towards that today was my first race of this training cycle

 initially i started with short 20 minute walks then adding in 30 seconds of running every few minutes then longer again eventually i was just running and ive been consistently running 45 times a week for the last 2 months though ive run a few half marathons before ive always avoided any kind of speedwork  but this time ive been adding in a tempo run each week in addition to easy runs and my weekend long run im sure that doing this has helped me get used to running quicker and was a part of what allowed me to pb today

 prerace
all in all the omens for todays race were not positive adelaide is in the middle of a heat wave 7 straight days of over 37°c so my lead up runs this week have been hot as hell though id hoped for a good night sleep last night a combination of a madly barking neighborhood dog and 2 overnight breastfeeds meant that didnt happen either id also had a vague sense i might be getting a cold so i ate a shittonne of food yesterday and drowned it with water haha got up a bit before 6 pumped a feed for my daughter gobbled breakfast and we were out the door for 630 it was already getting warm and muggy as hell so glugged some more water had a gentle warm up and headed to the start line

 race
 you know those days where within 5 minutes you just know youre going to have a ripper run today was like that my main plan for the race was to go out steady i have a tendency to get a bit excited on race days and try to keep an even pace throughout the run it took so much self control to not go bounding off like a looney but i worked to keep myself around my goal pace of 5minkm passed my parents at the 2k mark who had surprised me by coming down to cheer me on  a lovely surprise 

by the turnaround at 5k i was still feeling great and knew i was on my way to a pb where i live is incredibly hilly  no such thing as a flat training run  so racing a flat course meant i was still feeling really fresh by 6k i knew i had plenty left in the tank and decided to stretch out and let my legs do the running had the wonderful experience of picking off runners that had shot past me at the start and by the last km i was working hard but loving life hearing my family and my husband cheering me on as i came round the final bend was fantastic as was looking at the race clock as i crossed the finish and seeing 49

 postrace
grabbed my finishers medal im a sucker for a good bit of bling and pulled off my shoes for the traditional postrace how many blisters did i get today 2 as it turned out i had planned to go home and have a wonderfully nutritious meal but then our daughter fell asleep in the car so we killed some time with a mcdonalds run  the 2 cheeseburgers and 6 chicken nuggets tasted phenomenal totally worth it p

and now onwards to my half marathon in april

old pr 348 crushed 

personal info this i feel must be included in all race report 47 yo male x smoker x heineken and absolute lover  been running for several years but not competitivelyabout 3 casual runs a week

i do not know how to start this report but if you want to have a better picture consult my post from january race report where i shaved 27 min off my earlier time 

httpswwwredditcomrrunningcommentsamcqw3racereportmarrakechinternationalmarathon2019

this time i shaved another 12 minutes and i feel that i can shave even more next time


this marathon wasn’t planned for it was like a 48 hours decision before doing it 
i ran about 42 km a week and bike about 90 to 100 km on a mountain bike so i am always keeping fit but i didn’t have any focus training for this marathon as i wasn’t planning on it


i ran a 137 a half marathon trail style in march the 24th and that was a pr and after that i just trained my usual 1 speed work out 1 tempo and a bit of a long run on week end these were all my week end runs since the half marathon i ran15km 11km17km 25km 11km


i didn’t carbo load or do any extra hydrating as again this was a lastminute decision my running buddies were not available for various reasons so i soldiered up at 530am drove to rabat which was about an hour 10 minutes’ drive all was smooth parking was available and all except for the friggin bib which i couldn’t buy in casablanca the day before coz they were all sold out all i had to do was ask the people around i ended up with more than 7 bibs all for 10km half and one marathon it was the one i needed so got that out of the way at 7am race was scheduled for 8am


i was lucky i always keep a toilet paper in the car this was helped me pr i guess haha went looking for long johns  found 5 and that is all they had dand it but showing up early always helps waited for maybe 5 min and did my deed number 2 again shit man hhh never a dirty place was more welcome than yesterday i was relieved


organization sucked 10km semi and marathon all started at the same time it was friggin chaos lots of kids women elderly walking and it was terrible i stayed patient and things didn’t clear until 2 to 3 km so i set the cruise ctrl on 5minute per km 


by km 18 or so marathon and half marathons runners were divided and i was running alone man but cruising i was popping a gel every water station and drinking some homemade electrolyte drink ate about 2 bananas as well during the whole thing and that was my nutrition and hydration plan


weather was over all cool about maybe 17 to 18 degrees it rained it shined it did all and the terrain was hilly as phuk some went on and on for what felt like 15km and such i was hitting my splits regardless of how i felt and that was the most important thing


i told myself to keep going in hope of finding a better gear but with the hills it was hard i slowed down by 10 to 15 sec for several km by km 34 it turned to a mind game a battle of wills luckily some random dude at km23 with his radio on came from behind we started chatting and isht and he decided to stick with me for whatever reason he was a god sent he was 9 years younger faster and a bit weird as he started kind of coaching talking singing …i didn’t mind he was my salvation we ran all the rest together and i am sure he could have ran way faster


those hills were terrible man and one of the toughest was 2km before the finish kept on fighting i was beat and all but still going the end was near and i could see the arch damn it i clocked 336 which i am very happy with i pumped my fists and you know the joy that comes with the finish i did it 


i can do better and i will shoot for sub 330 in marrakech which happens in january there is another marathon that i may run in september in agadir before but that has 2 loops with hills we shall see


with focus training and determination we can all make progress i would love to increase my mileage and work towards easing those last 6 miles of the marathon i feel like i just do the bare minimum of training nevertheless all is good

 training

i didn’t really follow an official training plan i basically just started adding a mile or two to my long runs each week starting in early december and went by how i felt i really underestimated myself which resulted in me being way ahead of schedule like several months ahead in my training come february i ended up finding a training schedule on the dearborn mi marathon website httpmartianracescominfotrainingschedulehttpmartianracescominfotrainingschedule and following that leading up to the race took all the advice i got here and never skipped a long run even on those cold icy 19 degree michigan days

x200b

 prerace

woke up meditated ate my “pre long run” ritualistic 2 pieces of toast with 40 grams of raspberry jam and headed to the race i live locally so my husband dropped me off and then walked down to the race a bit later i decided not to line up with a pacer because i didn’t want the mental pressure of trying to stick with a group in the case that i wanted to go fasterslowertake a bathroom break etc

x200b

 miles 1 to 13

what a blast thanks to the advice i’ve gotten in this sub i knew not to shoot out of the gate and to deliberately slow myself down to combat the adrenaline i fell into a really relaxed 10 minish pace and was able to maintain that very easily for 80 of the race my husband mom  dad and bff all were sitting at the halfway point cheering me on and it was such a wonderful warm feeling to see them all out there supporting me

 miles 13 to 18

in this race the marathon is 2 loops of the half marathon course so when i got to the halfway mark and started on lap 2 it was so much quieter than lap one which was good and bad it was nice not to be dodging people but it was also fairly boring this section of the race still felt fairly relaxed to the 8ish year old kid holding a never trust a fart sign at mile 17 please never change 

x200b

 miles 18 to 262

at about mile 18 i started to really get tired and i know this because that’s when i started counting down how many miles i had left some really great advice i read on this sub was to always just run the mile you’re in so that’s what i did to the best of my ability i stopped the mental math and tried to be present in the moment and remind myself that pain and exhaustion are temporary states i went through a lot of cycles of exhaustion and exhilaration from mile 21 to 24 the last couple miles were pretty difficult due to a large hill at the very end of the course i did all my training runs with this hill though so it was kind of like meeting an old friend for one last battle i loved it and i hated it once you get to the top of the hill the last mile or so to the finish is pretty much down hill and i had to stop myself from bursting into tears several times when people highfived me along the way because it was the first time i was 100 positive i was absolutely going to finish without walking for more than a few seconds at a time i crossed the finish line about 30 minutes earlier than i was intending and my family wasn’t ready for me because we all expected me to be slower i didn’t check my pace the entire race didn’t want to psych myself out and so it was a complete surprise to me that my mile average was about 2 minutes faster than i had anticipated it being

x200b

 postrace

cried while my mom hugged me and then went straight for the beer tent boston beer company makes a “262 brew” that was complimentary to the finishers and that was the most delicious beer i think i’ve ever had then i went with my family out to a local favorite brewpub got some food and came home to relax went for a walk in the evening to keep everything loose and it felt great i can see how people get hooked on thisanyone need a team member for a ragnar race

 training
before my first 50m appx 5 weeks ago i used the ultraladies training planhttpswwwultraladiescomfreetrainingplanshtml i don’t have enough knowledge to say if it is good or not but it got me through both races so there we go between the last 50 and this was… not ideal it took a solid 3 weeks of recovery to even feel back to normal and then it was practically time to “taper” what’s a reduction from zero though for perspective i did the single last year at 458 

 prerace
the brm double is unique in that it wasn’t originally intended to be an ultra but people just sorta started showing up the night before the race for the past couple years i believe it’s been done as a quad at one point last year was the first official “double” basically you start at either 100 or 230 am are generally unsupported sans some checkins then meet back at the start for the 735 gun neat i wasn’t sure how to handle this sleep wise so i ended up sleeping until after noon on saturday then just staying up nutrition was all caffeinated tailwind and gus lined up at the 100 and started running 

the brm claims the title of america’s toughest road marathon with appx 3600 feet of gain across three mountains in the single 

 race

 miles 1 to 18

honestly there’s not a ton to say here the weather was generally beautfiul about 60deg with a light breeze we had strong rain out of no where from mi 27 but otherwise a moonlit night with lightning on the horizon pretty much ideal lots of night road running is just following the line and chatting with whoever is beside 

ended up running with a motherdaughter pair who had a crew caw most of the route this came in handy i knew the route was unsupported but i was under the impression there was gonna be some water on the course i stumbled on an aid station that wasn’t built yet and got water 10 but otherwise i only remember one at 19 the crew car was extremely helpful to me and they rocked if i had one negative for this race it’s that i think the water stations should at least be up and active if unmanned 

 miles 19 to 22
 this is where the road started to beat me up a bit i’m pretty shitty at running downhills and this came to get me again with the emergence of a hotspot blister on my inner left heel the couple miles worth of downhills from 1920 and 2122 ish got me and i was getting passed by quite a few people here oh well carry on 

 miles 2226
i ran with an awesome woman who pushed my pace a bit the last 8 miles and we came into the halfway at 54x giving me nearly an hour to the start of lap two this was more than i planned on and ended up being very useful i ate a whole orange some salt and vinegar chips couple dates and some goldfish crackers changed shirt and socks leukotaped my blister and generally refueled felt decent going into the second half my first 50 i seriously underfueled the first half and mi 2635 were a slog waiting for new calories to kick in although i was physically tired i was further ahead of the nutritional death spiral this time and the hour allowed me a bunch of digestion time 

 miles 26 to 46
happened to unexpectedly run into a fraternity brother at the start he was a bit undertrained and our paces were pretty similar felt great having someone to run with and now running in the light was bringing me back to life i was definitely walking more of the inclines but i could still put down 10s on the flats which is fine for me that said the mile walk up the second long incline added friction to the blister which had now moved past the tape rookie mistake 

coming down a long sharp descent off the top of the roanoke star was my first “oh shit 50s are hard” moment i was running with a friend who had watched my video from last year and i just remember apologizing and letting him know i couldn’t hold the pace and to run on a few seconds later i stopped to stretch and think i yelled out a few words this was my first real doubt of the race the downhill was tearing my quads up and the heelstriking was savage on my blister just in a low point it was right then that the 6hr pace group passed me i’d interacted with the 6hr pacer on insta the few days before the race jokingly saying something like “if i’m crying you have permission to yell at me” she was an absolute rockstar knew everyone’s name in the group and immediately told me to get on with her and just hang with the group just having that group around me was so useful she was an excellent pacer and the groups pace was such that we walked the climbs which i needed it just worked out really well for me 

what i lacked in downhill speed i made up for in powerhiking and i ended up getting to the top of peakwood the third  sixth and final before the group i began the mile descent and ended up getting passed by the group unable to run down at their pace that said she drug me through to mi 2046 and that was good enough to give me something like 3hr to cover 7mi which i knew i could do with all the climbs behind me 

 miles 46 to 524
not quite a death march but not pretty walked the inclines ran the flats as hard as running was my midfoot strike kept it muuuuch more comfortable than walking blister the crowd support in the communities on mi 2226 is just great and all the fruit and cheering really kept me going 
trudged through to the finish and the pacer was there to cheer me on ended up coming in 11 min behind them for a total of 611 on lap 2 and 1151 for the total 

 what’s next
i have a lot of weaknesses mostly related to speed and strength i can keep going a good distance yes but i don’t feel like i have the strength i should and i’m definitely not very fast last year just doing the single i ran a 455 on this course i could beat that now but not by a lot my 1822 lsd flat run pace is about 1000 and my race day pace would be a minute faster i know i need to build strength that said i’m taking a break from running for now i run because i love to run i’m proud of having completed two 50s but the tail end of training became simply boring just out right mind numbing boredom i can only run the same trails listen to the same music hear the same podcasts so much before i go crazy i intend to continue running but once i’m recovered i’m going to hit structured bike training hard in an attempt to get a lot more powerful on the bike that combined with some strength work will hopefully set me up well for the return to running in due time 

tldr i freaking love the blue ridge marathon

reduction from zero though for perspective i did the single last year at 458  preracethe brm double is unique in that it wasn’t originally intended to be an ultra but people just sorta started showing up the night before the race for the past couple years i believe it’s been done as a quad at one point last year was the first official “double” basically you start at either 100 or 230 am are generally unsupported sans some checkins then meet back at the start for the 735 gun neat i wasn’t sure how to handle this sleep wise so i ended up sleeping until after noon on saturday then just staying up nutrition was all caffeinated tailwind and gus lined up at the 100 and started running the brm claims the title of america’s toughest road marathon with appx 3600 feet of gain across three mountains in the single  race miles 1 to 18honestly there’s not a ton to say here the weather was generally beautfiul about 60deg with a light breeze we had strong rain out of no where from mi 27 but otherwise a moonlit night with lightning on the horizon pretty much ideal lots of night road running is just following the line and chatting with whoever is beside ended up running with a motherdaughter pair who had a crew caw most of the route this came in handy i knew the route was unsupported but i was under the impression there was gonna be some water on the course i stumbled on an aid station that wasn’t built yet and got water 10 but otherwise i only remember one at 19 the crew car was extremely helpful to me and they rocked if i had one negative for this race it’s that i think the water stations should at least be up and active if unmanned  miles 19 to 22 this is where the road started to beat me up a bit i’m pretty shitty at running downhills and this came to get me again with the emergence of a hotspot blister on my inner left heel the couple miles worth of downhills from 1920 and 2122 ish got me and i was getting passed by quite a few people here oh well carry on  miles 2226i ran with an awesome woman who pushed my pace a bit the last 8 miles and we came into the halfway at 54x giving me nearly an hour to the start of lap two this was more than i planned on and ended up being very useful i ate a whole orange some salt and vinegar chips couple dates and some goldfish crackers changed shirt and socks leukotaped my blister and generally refueled felt decent going into the second half my first 50 i seriously underfueled the first half and mi 2635 were a slog waiting for new calories to kick in although i was physically tired i was further ahead of the nutritional death spiral this time and the hour allowed me a bunch of digestion time  miles 26 to 46happened to unexpectedly run into a fraternity brother at the start he was a bit undertrained and our paces were pretty similar felt great having someone to run with and now running in the light was bringing me back to life i was definitely walking more of the inclines but i could still put down 10s on the flats which is fine for me that said the mile walk up the second long incline added friction to the blister which had now moved past the tape rookie mistake coming down a long sharp descent off the top of the roanoke star was my first “oh shit 50s are hard” moment i was running with a friend who had watched my video from last year and i just remember apologizing and letting him know i couldn’t hold the pace and to run on a few seconds later i stopped to stretch and think i yelled out a few words this was my first real doubt of the race the downhill was tearing my quads up and the heelstriking was savage on my blister just in a low point it was right then that the 6hr pace group passed me i’d interacted with the 6hr pacer on insta the few days before the race jokingly saying something like “if i’m crying you have permission to yell at me” she was an absolute rockstar knew everyone’s name in the group and immediately told me to get on with her and just hang with the group just having that group around me was so useful she was an excellent pacer and the groups pace was such that we walked the climbs which i needed it just worked out really well for me what i lacked in downhill speed i made up for in powerhiking and i ended up getting to the top of peakwood the third  sixth and final before the group i began the mile descent and ended up getting passed by the group unable to run down at their pace that said she drug me through to mi 2046 and that was good enough to give me something like 3hr to cover 7mi which i knew i could do with all the climbs behind me  miles 46 to 524not quite a death march but not pretty walked the inclines ran the flats as hard as running was my midfoot strike kept it muuuuch more comfortable than walking blister the crowd support in the communities on mi 2226 is just great and all the fruit and cheering really kept me going trudged through to the finish and the pacer was there to cheer me on ended up coming in 11 min behind them for a total of 611 on lap 2 and 1151 for the total  what’s nexti have a lot of weaknesses mostly related to speed and strength i can keep going a good distance yes but i don’t feel like i have the strength i should and i’m definitely not very fast last year just doing the single i ran a 455 on this course i could beat that now but not by a lot my 1822 lsd flat run pace is about 1000 and my race day pace would be a minute faster i know i need to build strength that said i’m taking a break from running for now i run because i love to run i’m proud of having completed two 50s but the tail end of training became simply boring just out right mind numbing boredom i can only run the same trails listen to the same music hear the same podcasts so much before i go crazy i intend to continue running but once i’m recovered i’m going to hit structured bike training hard in an attempt to get a lot more powerful on the bike that combined with some strength work will hopefully set me up well for the return to running in due time tldr i freaking love the blue ridge marathon this post was generated using the new racereportrhttpscoachviewgithubioracereportr powered by

just a quick note to start things off this race was a blast  it was very well organized and lincoln is a great town  the course was fun and if you do the full marathon you will get to see the elites at nearly arms length  it is also a national guard marathon team qualifier so the guardsmen are out in force both running and crewing  i think its worth saying that i greatly appreciated their effortsservice during the race and overall to our country  if youre in the midwest and looking for a good race this one is definitely worth it  one note of caution get your room lined up and to dinner early the night before as its typically the same weekend as university of nebraskas graduation so theres a lot of people in town  

 training
i took this race on as something of a stretch  im somewhat recently back into running about 9 months ago after my wife and i had twins my mom passed away from als and made a careerhome move  i had also put on a lot of weight  when i finally decided i wanted to do this race i was 17 weeks out  while i had lost about 40 pounds i was still 30 from where i really should be  all considered i decided to go for it because i love running and was itching to try another marathon after a not so great finish on my last one in 2016  i chose to do hal higdons novice 2 plan more or less  early on it was difficult because i live in iowa and we had one of the worst late winters in state history  but i gutted through runs in the snow and cold and by race day i was down to a net loss of 55 pounds and clipping off miles at a better pace than 3 years prior  i wasnt 100 ready but it was as close as i was going to get all considered  

 prerace
i have 4 kids so the day before the race we went to the the omaha zoo highly highly recommend so that the whole weekend wasnt all about me running  looking back walking around the zoo all day might not have been the best but when you have a big family you make sacrifices  the good thing was everyone was tired so we all had a good night sleep  the day of the race i got up early got my stuff together  sport beans cliff blocks phone hat and headphones and was out the door  i did a really short warm up and lined up by 635ish 700 am gun  i had a little bit of nerves but i actually felt pretty good

 race
where do i start  the first two miles felt off  my times were fine but it just didnt feel like things were flowing like they normally do on long runs  luckily after a couple miles the rust fell off and i got into a good rhythm  i was with the 340350 pace group and for the most part stayed with them  my one gripe was that the half and full marathon run the same course through 131 so you constantly have the urge to keep pace with the halfers  i mostly fought that off and was having a lot of fun  i finished the front half in 152 so right on my goal pace  looking back thats about where things started to change  

after the halfers peeled off to their finish the course got lonely  i went from being surrounded by tons of people to only having 3 people anywhere near me  no problem i kept to my plan and pushed forward  by mile 18 i could feel two things heat and hills  the back half was punctuated by a bunch of bridge underpasses and some long gradual hills and there was no clouds and the temps were getting into the 70s  i still felt pretty good but by 20 i was starting to cramp  my wife and kids had setup to cheer at the mile 1721 spot out and back course and she said that at 17 i looked awesome but at 21 i was starting to look baked  by mile 22 i was cramping pretty bad so i switched to running for 8 minutes and walking for 2  my splits blew up  i was pretty bummed when the 350 and then the 400 pacers passed me but i was still on pb pace  fast forward to 400 and i rounded the corner to the nebraska football stadium ran in and across the 50 yard line and finish line  i was done  my legs were cramping but i actually felt great

 postrace
post race i got my medal and just soaked in being on the stadium  i hadnt finished as well as i wanted but it was still a pb and im not going to be upset about a 10 minute better time  and like i said above i actually felt good  compared to my last marathon in which i felt like death worked me over at the end i was in great spirits and despite stiff legs i was moving just fine  today im back at work and dont feel any worse than i did after any other long training run  

i feel like i passed through a mental barrier in that things hurt but i didnt let it get me down  i simply noted it and kept going  i also felt more active in my pursuit if that makes any sense  overall i think this was exactly the gut check i needed and was the reason i decided to take on this race so quickly after starting running again

im going to run the chicago marathon in october for the les turner als foundation so i now have a good benchmark to set my training against  if anything im more antsy to get back at it than i was to get to the race  my hope is that i continue to improve as i increase training volume and work on form  ive also started including yoga and strength and stability training into my routine which seems to be helping too  lastly im working on my nutrition and diet so i can get down to a good weight  hopefully the net result of all that is better times and more fun on runs

finish in sub130yes

x200b

the sheffield half is a hilly half marathon  the first 5 miles steadily climb out of sheffield and into the peak district  its then an 8mile dash back down to the city centre  theres over 800ft of climbing in the first 5 miles which certainly takes the speed out of the legs

x200b

 training

its been my first big block of training since i did the run last year  i got 146 before and wanted to at least beat my time after putting in lots of hours  id done a fairly generic training programme of 1 long run 1 interval session 1 tempo run and an easy run  this really helped build my endurance and speed until i got an it band injury at a fell race in january  this resulted in around 8 weeks of rest and very slowing building back up to running even 3 miles  4 weeks out from the race i could finally do runs of around 8 miles again but i certainly felt i wasnt going to be at my best

on my final full week my general pace had dropped to 740 avg for 8 miles  oddly id gotten quicker through no speed work

x200b

this had been my first rel time training as a runner since october 2018 as i normally cycle instead

x200b

 race day

id planned out my splits quite meticulously to try and get as close to 130 as i could but thinking 135 was more believable  m plan was to complete the first 5 miles in 40mins or under and then kill myself on the descent back in to make up my lost time this meant my first 5 miles would be an average of around 8minmile and the final 8 would have to be 615minmile  this would massively be at the top end of what i could do

x200b

i got to the 5mile mark at around 37mins which gave me a few more minutes for the descent  i felt strong going up and kept nearly all my pacing under 8minmile pace which i didnt expect  i was riding high in my heart rate but i always seem to racing so i knew i could hold it

at the top of the hill i necked a gel as i knew id probably dipped into my glycogen reserves a fair bit and began lifting the tempo  i felt really comfortable until about mile 910 where it levelled back out and climbed a little  this little sting really hurt and knocked my pace to around 64858minmile  its also when i began to feel quite tired too

i caught the 130 pacer with about 1 mile to go and knew it was possible to get my main goal  my heart rate had crept up to around 180bpm which put me massively into the red  with 12 a mile to go i thought i was cooked  the pacer was a god send and spurred me on to just dig that little bit more  crossing the line was such a good feeling and seeing that time under 130

the crowds and support were amazing and its always such a popular course  i now have another half in 4 weeks in leeds which is significantly flatter so hopefully i can match or knock some time off

just a few weeks after running the alloa half marathon it was time for stirling and i was hoping to improve my time a little

i had been watching the weather forecast for a few days and it was gradually improving  at the start of the week the forecast was 3c and 50 chance of rain but come the day my car was telling me it was 10c on the way to the event

i parked at linden avenue which still had a decent number of spaces available around 0715 and joined the throng of runners walking the short distance to kings park  the area was well set up with a huge array of portaloos and urinals at one end of the park a stage at the opposite end and baggage buses out on the road  i used the first second for the mass warmup  a wee bit of aerobics which was great fun to do

finally i went to the buses stripped down to my vest and shorts and left my bag on the bus  it was time

the start was a bit weird  it was a mass start  we were to start out on the road with marathon runners on the left and half marathoners on the right  we would keep that configuration until the end of queens road at which point the marathon runners would go left onto dumbarton road and the half marathoners would turn right onto albert place  what ensued was a rather crowded mess i joined the throng through a gap in the crush barriers and the whole thing was just a bit of a pain  but no matter we got across the starting line and the race was on

the route took you out of kings park and then through stirlings pedestrianised shopping street  it continued gently downhill to cowane street then turned back on itself to goosecroft road before crossing over to the new cinema and heading out of town towards the peak  after that we went round the back of the football ground and through the school with many a twist and turn before we came out to the a91

the run changed its character a little here opening out onto a wider road a91 for just over a mile  i successfully passed the 215 210 and 2hr pacers here hoping against hope that i wouldnt see them again until i had crossed the finish line

at the a907 roundabout we turned left to go along the alloa road  there were a few people gathered at the roundabout to cheer us on and as we got closer to causewayhead the numbers increased  a few kids on the inside of the causewayhead roundabout seemed delighted to get a high five  thank you to them for their support

i have often run from stirling uni east along the alloa road and had never really noticed that it goes downhill when youre going that way  but there was a distinct climb all the way when you are travelling west

eventually we reached stirling uni where we take a sharp right turn and go up through the university  i live halfway up a hill so all my runs from home involve some degree of hill training  that was definitely to my advantage here as i was able to get up the hill and pass a few people on the climb  i spent much of this stretch chasing the 145 pacer but didnt quite manage to catch up with him  soon we were rewarded by reaching the back gate of the university and a steep downhill to the a91 hillfoots roundabout and here i somehow managed to get past the 145 pacer as we started heading south on the a91  

the a91 is quite a tough stretch to run  up until this point i had been overtaking loads of people  albeit that number was diminishing as the race progressed  now there was very little passing going on as we had all mostly found our natural positions on the run relative to each other  so the couple of miles from mile 9 to 11 were a bit of a slog  

our route took us back pretty much the way we had come though this time we didnt have to twist and turn through the school and the football pitch  instead we ran in front of the peak and back past the cinema  and this is where we started to climb with the last mile being pretty much uninterrupted uphill  

going through the shopping street was great  there were large crowds there cheering us on  then we pass the end of the street and there is still quite a hard stretch to get through before the finish  the final stretch is up a short hill into kings park and the audience here was great  shouting our names and cheering us on  thank you to all of them

and then i was through  i didnt quite collapse but i was definitely tired and i dont think i could have given much more  my time  14211  was three minutes faster than alloa and my secondbest ever half marathon time  i collected a goody bag with tshirt medal and an assortment of goodies from kelloggs and jointace and gratefully accepted the embrace of the grass for a few minutes as i got my breath back

and that was about it  i collected my stuff from the baggage bus and hung around for a while to cheer on some finishers  i was impressed to see the first two or three marathon finishers who managed their 262 miles in a time i wouldnt have thought bad for a half  

i did notice that someone had collapsed about a hundred yards short of the finish line but i only noticed because there was already a group of around five marshals there getting the runner onto a stretcher to be looked after  so full marks to the organisers for having skilled marshals available  indeed i would say that the marshaling the signposting the road closures etc were absolutely firstclass throughout  

there are some issues to do with the start that need to be thought through but all in all this was a firstclass event and one i plan to do again in 2020

fun to dofinally i went to the buses stripped down to my vest and shorts and left my bag on the bus  it was timethe start was a bit weird  it was a mass start  we were to start out on the road with marathon runners on the left and half marathoners on the right  we would keep that configuration until the end of queens road at which point the marathon runners would go left onto dumbarton road and the half marathoners would turn right onto albert place  what ensued was a rather crowded mess i joined the throng through a gap in the crush barriers and the whole thing was just a bit of a pain  but no matter we got across the starting line and the race was onthe route took you out of kings park and then through stirlings pedestrianised shopping street  it continued gently downhill to cowane street then turned back on itself to goosecroft road before crossing over to the new cinema and heading out of town towards the peak  after that we went round the back of the football ground and through the school with many a twist and turn before we came out to the a91the run changed its character a little here opening out onto a wider road a91 for just over a mile  i successfully passed the 215 210 and 2hr pacers here hoping against hope that i wouldnt see them again until i had crossed the finish lineat the a907 roundabout we turned left to go along the alloa road  there were a few people gathered at the roundabout to cheer us on and as we got closer to causewayhead the numbers increased  a few kids on the inside of the causewayhead roundabout seemed delighted to get a high five  thank you to them for their supporti have often run from stirling uni east along the alloa road and had never really noticed that it goes downhill when youre going that way  but there was a distinct climb all the way when you are travelling westeventually we reached stirling uni where we take a sharp right turn and go up through the university  i live halfway up a hill so all my runs from home involve some degree of hill training  that was definitely to my advantage here as i was able to get up the hill and pass a few people on the climb  i spent much of this stretch chasing the 145 pacer but didnt quite manage to catch up with him  soon we were rewarded by reaching the back gate of the university and a steep downhill to the a91 hillfoots roundabout and here i somehow managed to get past the 145 pacer as we started heading south on the a91  the a91 is quite a tough stretch to run  up until this point i had been overtaking loads of people  albeit that number was diminishing as the race progressed  now there was very little passing going on as we had all mostly found our natural positions on the run relative to each other  so the couple of miles from mile 9 to 11 were a bit of a slog  our route took us back pretty much the way we had come though this time we didnt have to twist and turn through the school and the football pitch  instead we ran in front of the peak and back past the cinema  and this is where we started to climb with the last mile being pretty much uninterrupted uphill  going through the shopping street was great  there were large crowds there cheering us on  then we pass the end of the street and there is still quite a hard stretch to get through before the finish  the final stretch is up a short hill into kings park and the audience here was great  shouting our names and cheering us on  thank you to all of themand then i was through  i didnt quite collapse but i was definitely tired and i dont think i could have given much more  my time  14211  was three minutes faster than alloa and my secondbest ever half marathon time  i collected a goody bag with tshirt medal and an assortment of goodies from kelloggs and jointace and gratefully accepted the embrace of the grass for a few minutes as i got my breath backand that was about it  i collected my stuff from the baggage bus and hung around for a while to cheer on some finishers  i was impressed to see the first two or three marathon finishers who managed their 262 miles in a time i wouldnt have thought bad for a half  i did notice that someone had collapsed about a hundred yards short of the finish line but i only noticed because there was already a group of around five marshals there getting the runner onto a stretcher to be looked after  so full marks to the organisers for having skilled marshals available  indeed i would say that the marshaling the signposting the road closures etc were absolutely firstclass throughout  there are some issues to do with the start that need to be thought through but all in all this was a firstclass event and one i plan to do again in 2020 this post was generated using the new racereportrhttpscoachviewgithubioracereportr powered by

 training
i had never really ran at all before last august  my employer was part of a 5k so i decided to train for it  i fell in love with running and decided to start training for a half marathon right away  i downloaded nike run club and started a plan for february i convinced my buddy to run it with me and luckily there was a half marathon in our city in april   two weeks ago after running my last long run pre race i felt great  the next day i could feel myself getting sick  i got the flu and was pretty sick the next couple days  i had a lingering cough and was still coughing up phlegm so two days ago i decided to go to the doctor basically i had bronchitis and an ear infection  the doctor gave me antibiotics a steroid and an inhaler  during this time i was struggling even running 35 miles so i was very worried  

 prerace
i got up at 430 am and stretched for about 30 minutes  my buddy came at 530 to pick me up and we headed down to the arena  we got there pretty early so we were just walking around for awhile  we got corralled in at 630  i was a very nervous excited  the weather was perfect about 43 degrees and cloudy

 miles 1 to 35
i started out fairly slow  i really wanted to test out what kind of stamina i would have today  i ran the first two miles with my friend then he took off  i felt better then i had in two weeks so i was fairly optimistic

 miles 35 to 85
around mile 78 i was struggling with breathing  i had to slow down a bit to catch my breath  otherwise i really liked this stretch  most of it was running around lake michigan

 miles 85 to 131
i felt great from 8511 miles  at about 11 miles i started feeling gas  it was up hill and my legs were beat  i just emptied out the tank  i soaked it all in i almost teared up  the feeling of accomplishment was unreal  

 whats next
i’m trying to decide what’s next  i think i want to give a full marathon a shot  is there any good plan from going from a half to a full  i just feel like this is the summer  i’m in the best shape of my life and i have some time to train this summer

was fat started running to lose weight got less fat liked running started to lose weight to run better ran better ran more you might be like me you might not if you are or were like me i’m hoping my race report can inspire you to keep going 

x200b

or maybe you’re reading this in late 2019early 2020 wondering if you should run the los angeles marathon and reading past race reports to prepare in which case i have detailed stuff for each section or maybe maybe you’re just like me and read this subreddit like it’s the new harry potter novel so you’ll read anything posted in which case your ravenous hunger for reading all things running related may be satiated by only reading the overview parts of each race section or you know maybe read the various sections as you please in no particular order following no rhyme or reasonan a la carte race report if you will if this is you i recommend the last few sections where my marathon began to feel like a marathon and not just an extended long run there’s drama there some real internal conflict and maybe some sentences i’m a little proud of 

okay here we go my first race report i’ve been waiting a long time to do one if you can’t tell 

x200b

 training

ran at least a halfmarathon distance each weekend since november slowly built up my long runs to 30km nothing special with the training just built up to 3540 miles a week sometimes a little more sometimes a little less when i felt weird painsthe weather did not permit it 

x200b

 prerace

the weather forecast was perfect but dodger stadium was freezing woke up early enough i thought to drink coffee and be able to use the restroom before the race started turns out that plan worked but not soon enough i was waiting in line to use the restrooms at dodger stadium until about 15 minutes before the start at that point i had to join wayyyyy in the back of the open corral so if you’re reading this to plan your la marathon drink coffee but earlier than you think the stalls at dodger stadium are nicer than a porta potty but you also don’t want to be at the back of an open corral or maybe you do that way you can feel like you’re way faster than you are passing up all those people who started earlier than you 

a dumbo drone came out and flew around the stadium because sure why not and the race started took about another 20 minutes to clear the start line yee haw i thought here we go…

miles 113 euphoria

overview 

honestly these miles blew by i think the adrenalineexcitement at just running in a marathon made these miles and this may make me a bit crazy for thinking so fun i just remembered to stay hydrated take some gatorade every other mile like planned at this stage of the race i just cruised at 1000mi ticking off mile after mile 

details 

because of the long lines for the bathrooms at dodger stadium i had to start close to the back of the open corral as such i didn’t get going until about 20 minutes after the clock started the course takes you around dodger stadium and down vin scully avenue which is the first real downhill portion of the day crowds here were pretty thin until you get into chinatown the hill leading past the disney concert hall is steep but the taiko drummers and good crowds here keep you going from here the course proceeded to echo park lots of great crowds heresome central american restaurants giving out oranges and bananas along the echo park lake there was a priest blessing runners with holy water kinda got pushed towards him by the crowd got blessed with holy water figured it wouldn’t hurtif nothing else it was like a light hosing down to keep temps down

after leaving the echo parksilver lake area the course goes through thai town and is otherwise pretty unremarkableshadeless until you get into hollywood the taller buildings provided plentiful shade and the thicker crowds here were a relief after running in the sun for so long notable sights included the egyptian theater walk of fame and a freddie mercury impersonator rockin’ out 

the course diverts a block south from hollywood boulevard to sunset boulevard where you proceed to the sunset strip and to west hollywood i used to live in weho felt nostalgic to be running through the sunset strip at this point i hit the halfway point and like planned decided to stop for a bathroom break the wait here for the porta potties was mercifully short although i almost ate it slowing down to a stop  

x200b

miles 1420 a beautiful day in the neighborhood

overview 

miles 14 through 20 would match the length of my long runs from training and though i continued to feel comfortable i knew that anything past mile 20 would be terra incognita which spooked me a bit knowing this i started to take it a bit easier on the uphill sections not quite slowing to a walk but definitely not my cruising speed tried to make up time on the downhill sections 

details 

mile 14 takes you through the sunset strip up to the whiskey agogo where the course takes a left down into the heart of west hollywood spectators here were definitely boozier but accommodating offering both bottles of water and mimosas after passing the drag queens blasting “i will survive” the course pulls into beverly hills along rodeo drive the crowds here werethin to say the least lots of expensive shops if you’re impressed by that sort of thing but really i just wanted to get through beverly hills as quickly as possible to get to…

my neighborhood or as close to my neighborhood as the marathon went if it’s a neighborhood i can run through from my apartment on a regular basis i’ve pretty much come to define it as “mine” the course rejoins santa monica boulevard and heads west towards the century city mall the hills here are a portent of what’s to come but i feel like having run many times along this stretch i knew what to expect after passing the mormon temple i approached mile 20 where i decided to pause and get a few good stretches in at this point i took my last gel shot tightened my shorts and proceeded past the pillars of heracles…

miles 2125 terra incognita

“if you are losing faith in humanity go out and watch a marathon”

x200b

overview 

there were nine lifethreatening emergencies during this year’s race i ran past one make no mistake the danger is real the monsters are real but so are the angels in brentwood i ran past the paralyzed man walking the marathon with an exoskeleton i hit “the wall” going up the long uphill stretch past brentwood i battled between walking and running when i felt the cool of the pacific i ran past the wall i finished i became a marathoner 

details 

this is where the marathon became “a marathon” before i was in known friendly territory now running past mile 20 i was in uncharted unknown seas the course headed north up sepulveda and frankly this was the toughest part with no shade available i could feel the salt drying on my face runner after runner began walking along this stretch i was tempted but kept pushing the course makes a left towards along wilshire towards the veterans hall 

i saw two bicycles in the middle of the course and in true angelino fashion thought “damn cyclists” but very quickly i saw the “medical” badges and gear and saw a marathoner had collapsed i won’t divulge into the details but i will say that it looked bad enough that any appetite to “push” through the wall was gone i felt uneasy and though i had run a thus far very conservative race i could not help but shake the image of this fallen runner from my mind the most difficult part of the marathon lay ahead and i was not sure if i wanted to push hard on the uphill 

the course turned right into brentwood were hash house harriers were out en masse handing out beer i’d have taken it but my mood had soured deeply and i was morose and wondering if all of this were worth it i was now falling out of my mood to run a marathon much less drink a beer the enthusiastic crowds here were blasting music and throwing what would otherwise have seemed like a great party but i just wasn’t in the mood anymore

but just past the roaring crowds in brentwood i regained that urge to run this year a paralyzed man was walking the la marathon course through the assistance of an exoskeleton i passed him around mile 225 seeing the obvious strain that he was in and the fight he had in his eyes snapped some vigor back in me the finish was just over this hill and i could and would finish and thus i proceeded 

the long hill going up san vicente became my own personal monster you can see in the strava data where i battle between walking and running walking and running stopping to stretch running again stretching some more running again it was a battle between myself and my legs of which every single fiber screamed and fought me in my fight against gravity’s persistent pull one day gravity shall have its day with me but this was not that day 

around mile 25 i felt the cool breeze of my home ocean the pacific hit my face the sweet smell of the sea beckoned me to the finish line

x200b

mile 26262 transcendence

x200b

overview 

i finished 

x200b

details 

the course curves as san vicente merges onto ocean boulevard for the last mile you run along the ocean and the canyon of people lined up along ocean boulevard is an encouraging sight i picked my “hares” and sought to keep up with them as their pace increased 

the finish line came in view the group of runners i was near kept speeding up and we may have passed literally hundreds of walkers at this point the crowd was definitely getting louder but i couldn’t hear them all that existed in this stretch was the finish line 

and the sound the sound of our footsteps hitting the asphalt the sound of our collective breathing the desperate groans 

the line kept getting closer and closer and closer and… holy shit that was the finish line holy shit that was the finish line 

x200b

 postrace

it was all over so quickly it certainly didn’t feel like 45000 that being said i was disappointed that my time was what it was but hitting the wall going up the hill and battling that morose feeling near brentwood did take something out of me 

i collected my medal and space blanket drank my chocolate milk like a good rrunning subscriber and laid down in the park near the finish line to recover

x200b

the end 

like so many of you on this subreddit laying down in a cool shady patch of grass after having run a marathon drinking that perfect nectar of carbs and protein we call “chocolate milk” my mind began to wander i began wondering what i should have done differently in my training where i could have gone faster if i really should have used the bathroom at mile 13 if taco bell was the best dinner premarathon if i should have pushed through some of the pain 

but most importantly i began to wonder when my next marathon would be so i could do this all over again

a beer the enthusiastic crowds here were blasting music and throwing what would otherwise have seemed like a great party but i just wasn’t in the mood anymorebut just past the roaring crowds in brentwood i regained that urge to run this year a paralyzed man was walking the la marathon course through the assistance of an exoskeleton i passed him around mile 225 seeing the obvious strain that he was in and the fight he had in his eyes snapped some vigor back in me the finish was just over this hill and i could and would finish and thus i proceeded the long hill going up san vicente became my own personal monster you can see in the strava data where i battle between walking and running walking and running stopping to stretch running again stretching some more running again it was a battle between myself and my legs of which every single fiber screamed and fought me in my fight against gravity’s persistent pull one day gravity shall have its day with me but this was not that day around mile 25 i felt the cool breeze of my home ocean the pacific hit my face the sweet smell of the sea beckoned me to the finish linex200bmile 26262 transcendencex200boverview i finished x200bdetails the course curves as san vicente merges onto ocean boulevard for the last mile you run along the ocean and the canyon of people lined up along ocean boulevard is an encouraging sight i picked my “hares” and sought to keep up with them as their pace increased the finish line came in view the group of runners i was near kept speeding up and we may have passed literally hundreds of walkers at this point the crowd was definitely getting louder but i couldn’t hear them all that existed in this stretch was the finish line and the sound the sound of our footsteps hitting the asphalt the sound of our collective breathing the desperate groans the line kept getting closer and closer and closer and… holy shit that was the finish line holy shit that was the finish line x200b postraceit was all over so quickly it certainly didn’t feel like 45000 that being said i was disappointed that my time was what it was but hitting the wall going up the hill and battling that morose feeling near brentwood did take something out of me i collected my medal and space blanket drank my chocolate milk like a good rrunning subscriber and laid down in the park near the finish line to recoverx200bthe end like so many of you on this subreddit laying down in a cool shady patch of grass after having run a marathon drinking that perfect nectar of carbs and protein we call “chocolate milk” my mind began to wander i began wondering what i should have done differently in my training where i could have gone faster if i really should have used the bathroom at mile 13 if taco bell was the best dinner premarathon if i should have pushed through some of the pain but most importantly i began to wonder when my next marathon would be so i could do this all over again x200bthe end

 training
i followed hansons beginner marathon planhttpscdnshopifycomsfiles117547753filesbeginnermarathonnewpdf2510896761829477751 i pretty much followed this to a t except i tapered more than the plan called for took 3 days completely off the last week my bonus supersecret training was riding my bike tofrom work a few days a week 10 miles each direction ideally i did 3 days a week but sometimes snow impaired that
im trying to build to a sub300 marathon and this is an early season step towards that my year goals are to do 309 now and then 304 in the fall that would be a bq for me and i would then target sub300 at boston

 prerace
i followed my standard race prep of getting up 15 hrs before race start eating my standard oatmeal breakfast pounding some cold coffee and then heading out to the race start i took care of a prerace poop and then did a shortened warmup normally i would do more warmup more but it was around 30 degrees at the time so i mainly stayed in my car to stay warm eventually i put on my garbage bag coat and lined up at the start given last years results i expected a lot more people to line up in front of me but no one really wanted to line up at the front the starting horn went and we were off

 race
the top 5 men at the time separated early somewhere around mile 12 we were already strung out quite a ways there were the 5 of us the lead woman and then at least a 30 second gap to the next group for the next few miles the lead woman and i kept alternating spots i would pass her on the downhill and she would pass me on the uphill it was nice to have some company eventually the course flattened out around mile 7 and she pulled quite a bit ahead of me i was happy to let her go because i was already running faster than i wanted
at about mile 8 i started to get worried my hip flexors were getting tight and my quads were getting tired by mile 10 i was really worried because these feelings kept getting worse it wasnt hard yet but i know how bad i was going to feel in another 10 thankfully at halfmarathon i was feeling better i was way ahead of pace so i was trying to reel myself in more aggressively through mile 20 i was in a really good rhythm and felt better additionally around 17 the lead woman was faltering so i finally passed her for the last time she still ended up winning
at mile 20 we met up with the halfmarathon that had started 15 hrs later so i folded in with the 140 halfmarathoners right as we merged i saw my friend i was hoping to pass i mocked him a bit and kept on chugging leaving him in the dust at this point i knew i was going to get sub309 as long as i didnt blow up so it was a lot of focusing on not going too fast
the big surprise was at mile 22 i got passed by another marathoner i was shocked because there were whole sections of the race where i couldnt see anyone behind or ahead of me it was a lonely race i was still maintaining pace so this guy had just picked up the pace i asked him which age group he was in hes 29 so i decided not to try keeping up with him
the last few miles had some brutal hills but i kept it together with a lot of swearing i got to the last tenth of a mile and i could see the finish line surprisingly i also saw another marathoner ahead of me that was potentially in the same age group he wasnt i decided i could catch him i dropped the hammer and passed him right before the finish securing 5th overall

 overall
im super happy with my time this was an 8 minute pr from last september and im feeling confident that i can train to get a bq in the fall
overall it was a good race for its size great organization well marked and a beautiful course i was worried how much highway running was involved but they did a good job closing lanes and having police at crossings so i never felt in danger its a pointtopoint in the middle of iowa so it doesnt have much fan support and there were only 295 finishers so if you want a loud wellpopulated course this isnt the one for you but if you want to cruise mostly by yourself for 262 miles its a solid choice

back story
in may i have a 40 mile obstacle course and in july i have a half iron man triathlon half marathon was signed up for only a couple of weeks ago as a push to train harder for both events

race
blue skies no rain or wind and a bit of a chill at temps starting at 4 degrees c

start of the race was pretty hectic with a lot of people jostling for position near the pacers and a lot of people burning out early as the first 3 miles is almost all uphill through the city
mid section of the race thinned out nicely through undulating country roads all around coventries outskirts the beautiful countryside took away the focus on the tightness in my right knee and allowed me to keep powering along at a much faster pace than usual 718mile 

then it was back into the city the streets were lined with spectators all offering high fives and jelly babies that coupled with the last 26 miles being dow hill allowed me to open up the legs and knock out a time much faster than i could dream of especially for my first half marathon

 training
i’ve been running on and off for about 6 years but only entered into very few races in october 2018 i ran my first half marathon back then my goal was to run it within 2 hours which i did i finished in ±155 my training back then was very minimal and i had a minor injury in advance 

for the firenze half marathon i wanted to push myself and improve my time i had asked a friend for advice and he provided a solid training schedule from december onwards i started training more seriously the schedule generally consisted of three runs a week starting slow 530km and steady 7km but quickly grew more intense one run of 10km at  a steady pace one 10km with changing speeds and one longer distance run 1518km the runs became easier and easier and the pace improved pretty well the steady pace runs averaged at 455km in the end the two weeks before the race i started to run less and prepare for the race

 prerace
there’s plenty of very tasty pasta to go around in italy so i ate well the day before i didn’t sleep particularly well but still felt rested had some early breakfast and coffee race started at 930 and felt fine travelled to the starting area by public transport which luckily was on time always an uncertainty in italy i arrived on time the weather was great 11c there was barely any wind and cloudy skies

 race
13km i wanted to follow the 145 pacers but they got out of sight quickly as all pacers started from the front and it was pretty overcrowded luckily the starting area allowed for easy overtaking i got into a 44045 pace until i caught up with the 145 pacers at 3 km

36km about half of the surface of the semimarathon is cobblestone the uneven surface area hurt my ankles a bit and i got minor side stitches at the same time i felt that the 445 pace wasn’t very challenging so i started to accelerate away from the 145 pacers 

69km the pains went away and the pace felt comfortable still i started to see the 140 pacers in the distance and thought why not try to push myself further i started to accelerate more so 

911km finished the first ‘lap’ and i felt like i was still buzzing with energy i caught up with the pacers and the pace still felt pretty comfortable yet again i picked up the pace

11km14km i saw the 135 pacers across the river far further down in the race i thought so far everything went well why not try and catch up with them too

1417km i pushed my pace as hard as i could in order to try and catch up for some reason i misjudged the previous lap and thought i only had 1km more to go once i realized my mistake i felt pretty stupid but i was not sprinting by any means and still felt like i had quite a bit of energy left 

1819km i felt my legs getting heavier and heavier and my heartbeat near its max my energy was getting lower and lower but the finish line is close

2021km i gave it my all and went all out i couldn’t catch up with the 135 pacers instead i finished barely behind then i was letdown a tiny bit until i realized that they started just before me i checked my watch and saw that i in fact did beat 135 my finish time was 13443

 postrace
i knew beforehand that 145 was a very beatable time and that i had thought i would finish somewhere between 140 and 145 the race went incredible and i did way better than expected the negative split gives me great hope to beat 130 within 6 months had planned to beat this in 2 years

 race strategy
as this was my first 50 i basically planned on keeping things as light and easy as possible for as long as possible i knew that i didnt really want to bank time early on and blow up late but i also couldnt hold back too much goal was to just keep it z2light z3 and walk when faced with hills

 strava with paces and details 
httpswwwstravacomactivities2207575936

 prerace
drove up with my crew and built out my drop bags kept things primarily the same as training with the exception of really putting on a lot of both bodyglide and squirels nut butter as well as leukotape with benzoine over the nips taking my anti chafe seriously 


 miles 0 to 13
right out of the gate i knew it was going to be one of those days it was about 35f at start in the mountains of virginia and snow the prior day meant the single tracks were compacted and icy not a great sign we ran a couple miles on the blue ridge parkway then ducked down to the singletrack before climbing up appx 1800 feet then descending again most of that a couple shin deep stream crossings were definitely enough to wake me up i had planned on needing to be aware of the final 13hr cutoff but honestly i wasnt expecting to be worried about the intermediates unfortunately the single track and climbing disagreed and even moving into the first crewed station at mile 13 i was getting close to cutoffs not fun fueled up with more tailwind and gu ate some fruit and pounded on 

 miles 13 to 26
i think perspective goes a long way when racing a while back the thought of writing 1326 as the second of four sections to this report would be crazy but here we are when you set out planning to run 52 running through 23 and 24 just doesnt seem too terrible from mi 1923 was another 2000 feet of slow grinding gain up a mountain followed by that same 2000 directly down into the aid station around mi 23 i was in a nutritional hole and looking eye level or up resulted in seeing a ton of snow and blurred vision oops the course was rather technical and rocky here with lots of baseball sized rocks some people flew down this but im just not good at it yet and i lost some free speed here trying to stay safe at the 26 i downed some ramen godsend a bunch of orange quarters more tailwind some boiled potatoes and a redbull restocked and turned around for that 2000 ft up again 

 miles 26 to 39
god that grind up hurt i knew i was slower than a lot of the field but the turnaround made me realize i was only beating something like 510 people i didnt know how many 50milers there were at that point but i remember how big a field started consisting of 25k 50k and 50m and it felt like i was on the bad end of things the grind up the mountain was slow with run breaks when i could muster it 8hrs in at this point and my concentration waned just long enough to bite me  near the top running with a group of 3 i got complacent and rolled my ankle it wasnt a race ender but i told my group to run on while i recomposed i only lost about 90s here but losing my pack probably lost me more than that as we went on descending this mountain down to the 35 i was informed i made the cut by 10min there were paved roads to 39 and i put some serious work in here and extended my cutoff buffer to 15min as i left 39 race time circa 915 here

 miles 39 to 524
the first few miles out of 39 are wooded flatland singletrack not the easiest to run and the stream crossings were just as cold at this point my body was actually feeling okay those nutritional debts at 26 had been filled and i was awake and active the balls of my feet were getting sore from the pounding but no blisters i could detect and things were slowly working running was feasible but painful but i knew i would lose time on the upcoming climb so i did my best averaging something like 13mins here it felt faster as i hit the switchbacks to climb i knew it would be close weather had forced an aid station change and i wasnt positive what time my exact cutoff at 49 would be the last mile of switchbacks gained 1000 ft for an avg grade of 19 it took me 30 min which is apparently good enough for 70th percentile fastest on the strava all time leaderboards for some perspective of this climb it hurt i passed about 6 or 7 people who all looked fitter than i am but somehow were sliding backwards i crested that mountain yelled a few swear words into the wilderness and ran on the next 3 miles to the 49 as were downhill and i somehow felt like i was flying the strava doesnt tell the whole story here my pace in this section averages to 16 min miles and honestly it felt way faster i know i was out of it nutritionally i dropped a bag  at some point and one aid station didnt contain anything i could take so part of it was perception but mentally i felt on top of the world weirdly honestly probably was delirious running on autopilot 

ran around the corner of a hillside and down a small hill when i started hearing cowbells the aid station was at the top of the hill i remember yelling out am i still in it to which i hear the race director yell back if you get here right now ran up the hill and was told myself and another woman who must have been just out of my sight made it by 2030s we were told to grab whatever nutrition we wanted but we couldnt stop i slammed three solo cups of coke and we took off we had 75 min to cover 34 miles through previously icy now muddy single track and about 500 feet total of gain she was an absolute rock star in front of me and every time i started to think i cant run this shed just take off and i knew it could be done so i had to follow her eventually we emerged from the track onto the blueridge parkway and ran in the pitch black we had headlamps but the fog made them useless through the dark a mile or two later we hit the resort and secured our spots as the final two finishers 

113 people started the 50m course 62 of us finished my time was 1257 out of a possible 1300 absolutely brutal course and i loved it will definitely be back 

 post race

httpsbelmonteracescomindexphpen goals goal  description  completed  a survivemake 13hr cutoff  yes  b sub 12  no  race strategyas this was my first 50 i basically planned on keeping things as light and easy as possible for as long as possible i knew that i didnt really want to bank time early on and blow up late but i also couldnt hold back too much goal was to just keep it z2light z3 and walk when faced with hills strava with paces and details httpswwwstravacomactivities2207575936 preracedrove up with my crew and built out my drop bags kept things primarily the same as training with the exception of really putting on a lot of both bodyglide and squirels nut butter as well as leukotape with benzoine over the nips taking my anti chafe seriously  miles 0 to 13right out of the gate i knew it was going to be one of those days it was about 35f at start in the mountains of virginia and snow the prior day meant the single tracks were compacted and icy not a great sign we ran a couple miles on the blue ridge parkway then ducked down to the singletrack before climbing up appx 1800 feet then descending again most of that a couple shin deep stream crossings were definitely enough to wake me up i had planned on needing to be aware of the final 13hr cutoff but honestly i wasnt expecting to be worried about the intermediates unfortunately the single track and climbing disagreed and even moving into the first crewed station at mile 13 i was getting close to cutoffs not fun fueled up with more tailwind and gu ate some fruit and pounded on  miles 13 to 26i think perspective goes a long way when racing a while back the thought of writing 1326 as the second of four sections to this report would be crazy but here we are when you set out planning to run 52 running through 23 and 24 just doesnt seem too terrible from mi 1923 was another 2000 feet of slow grinding gain up a mountain followed by that same 2000 directly down into the aid station around mi 23 i was in a nutritional hole and looking eye level or up resulted in seeing a ton of snow and blurred vision oops the course was rather technical and rocky here with lots of baseball sized rocks some people flew down this but im just not good at it yet and i lost some free speed here trying to stay safe at the 26 i downed some ramen godsend a bunch of orange quarters more tailwind some boiled potatoes and a redbull restocked and turned around for that 2000 ft up again  miles 26 to 39god that grind up hurt i knew i was slower than a lot of the field but the turnaround made me realize i was only beating something like 510 people i didnt know how many 50milers there were at that point but i remember how big a field started consisting of 25k 50k and 50m and it felt like i was on the bad end of things the grind up the mountain was slow with run breaks when i could muster it 8hrs in at this point and my concentration waned just long enough to bite me  near the top running with a group of 3 i got complacent and rolled my ankle it wasnt a race ender but i told my group to run on while i recomposed i only lost about 90s here but losing my pack probably lost me more than that as we went on descending this mountain down to the 35 i was informed i made the cut by 10min there were paved roads to 39 and i put some serious work in here and extended my cutoff buffer to 15min as i left 39 race time circa 915 here miles 39 to 524the first few miles out of 39 are wooded flatland singletrack not the easiest to run and the stream crossings were just as cold at this point my body was actually feeling okay those nutritional debts at 26 had been filled and i was awake and active the balls of my feet were getting sore from the pounding but no blisters i could detect and things were slowly working running was feasible but painful but i knew i would lose time on the upcoming climb so i did my best averaging something like 13mins here it felt faster as i hit the switchbacks to climb i knew it would be close weather had forced an aid station change and i wasnt positive what time my exact cutoff at 49 would be the last mile of switchbacks gained 1000 ft for an avg grade of 19 it took me 30 min which is apparently good enough for 70th percentile fastest on the strava all time leaderboards for some perspective of this climb it hurt i passed about 6 or 7 people who all looked fitter than i am but somehow were sliding backwards i crested that mountain yelled a few swear words into the wilderness and ran on the next 3 miles to the 49 as were downhill and i somehow felt like i was flying the strava doesnt tell the whole story here my pace in this section averages to 16 min miles and honestly it felt way faster i know i was out of it nutritionally i dropped a bag  at some point and one aid station didnt contain anything i could take so part of it was perception but mentally i felt on top of the world weirdly honestly probably was delirious running on autopilot ran around the corner of a hillside and down a small hill when i started hearing cowbells the aid station was at the top of the hill i remember yelling out am i still in it to which i hear the race director yell back if you get here right now ran up the hill and was told myself and another woman who must have been just out of my sight made it by 2030s we were told to grab whatever nutrition we wanted but we couldnt stop i slammed three solo cups of coke and we took off we had 75 min to cover 34 miles through previously icy now muddy single track and about 500 feet total of gain she was an absolute rock star in front of me and every time i started to think i cant run this shed just take off and i knew it could be done so i had to follow her eventually we emerged from the track onto the blueridge parkway and ran in the pitch black we had headlamps but the fog made them useless through the dark a mile or two later we hit the resort and secured our spots as the final two finishers 113 people started the 50m course 62 of us finished my time was 1257 out of a possible 1300 absolutely brutal course and i loved it will definitely be back  post racebrought back a lot of postironman memories in which i ate absolutely

 training

i began training in january as a very novice runner i had never run more than 5 km before and me being crazy decided that i needed to run a marathon to prove to myself that i could do anything i set my mind to 

i followed the 16 week plan from nyrr and ran in the morning i didnt do any speedwork or tempo runs just focused on distance my goal was just to finish and i am quite slow so it was okay for me being a professional ballet dancer i have good anaerobic fitness but terrible cardio skillspleased to say my stamina is so much better now

x200b

 prerace

when i picked up my bib it really hit me  i was going to do this after a panic moment on saturday i had mashed potatoes and went to sleep the morning of the race i woke up and ate an apple and some coffee since i couldnt stomach much else i got to the race and the jitters were real i tried to calm myself like i would for a performance and loaded up my best playlist entitled run faster btch i met the 500 pace leader and he calmed me down saying that we would get through this together and then we were off 

x200b

 race

everyone started out quite fast i remembered the advice of rfirstmarathon and took my time but felt kind of bad for being slow the first 3 miles were on cobblestone streets which was tricky i lost the pace group but caught up to them around mile 7 i was straight jammin to nas 

at 30 km the fatigue set in i was doing quite well hadnt walked yet but then the sun came out and it became very warm i drank lots of gatorade and magnesium sports drink and ate half a banana every 5 km 

that last 3 km i started to walk then my angel came out of nowhere another runner came by and told me no you have to finish and took my elbow and we limped and ran towards the finish when i saw the arch i started to cry 

all my friends had come to watch the finish line i had no idea i ran across the finish line sobbing  a little girl gave me a finishers medal and a bottle of water and i was overwhelmed i did it i ran a marathon

 postrace

i ate a very good veggie burger and kept walking around for the rest of the day so i wouldnt get sore even so i was incredibly sore the next day and had trouble walking down the stairs 

but i am still coming down from the experience i learned so much about myself throughout the training process i learned that i quit right before the end of things and i didnt this time i finished 

i plan to run another half marathon in the fall with my dad and i want to improve my marathon time in the future

 training
for all intents and purposes this halfmarathon was not my final goal as it was one of the entries in my 16week marathon training plan the plan i use comes from garmin connects website there are some plans there that can be downloaded into a compatible garmin watch and i have been using their marathon training plan that uses hr intensity instead of time or distance for almost all sessions so in other words a typical easy run would be something like run for 30 minutes at z2 and an interval run would be something like run for 4 minutes at z4 followed by 1 minute rest x 4 etc

however i dealt with what im assuming is sciatica from the end of march to midapril walking in shoes was painful though interestingly enough running wasnt as painful however i decided to significantly cut down on my mileage during that time even though i realized i wouldnt be able to keep racking up the mileage needed for the marathon i eventually had to postpone the actual marathon primarily for other reasons though this also contributed 

despite all this it was too late to get a refund for my entry fee and the organizers already sent me my swag and bib i figured that since there would be a swoop car following at the very end i would attempt to run as far as i can go and then hop on the car 

 prerace
my prerace dinner was a mediumsized pizza split with my spouse before i went to bed i prepped all the things i would want or need tomorrow  packing my running belt with energy gels id and money charging my earphones and phone pinning the bib on my singlet all that fun stuff and then i tried very fitfully to sleep only to realize that i was waking up almost every two hours 

on race day i got up at 5am again because of nerves and i had a couple bananas and a mug of almond milk i was going to get regular milk but i realized i had minor lactose intolerance so almond milk was seen as the better idea i had what i thought was a good omen when shortly after getting off the subway my stomach loudly proclaimed i had to go to the bathroom asap and i noticed the bathroom was very nearby very clean and very empty i purged as much as i could cleaned up and headed out to drop my bag off and meet my fellow running club members who were taking part that day 

 race strategy
my initial goal was to finish the race within 23000 the designated cutoff time if possible i remembered from prior 10ks i did that there were pacers for the half and fullmarathon races each with balloons showing their estimated finish time i initially considered setting a basic slow alert at 700km after doing the math and finding that 700 was the slowest average speed at which i should run in order to hit 230 however i disabled the alert and decided to stick close to the 230 pacers from start until end 

 race 0km to 10km
from the getgo i actuallyfelt good i felt like keeping up with the pacers was doable if not easy and i ignored everyone else who took off in a bolt it felt like most sunday long runs albeit a little faster than im used to 

at the 5km mark i stopped by the water station grabbed water and gatorade and continued running however the pacers took a little longer to drink so i decided to just go for now and eventually the pacers caught up 

 race 10km to 15km
once i saw the 10km sign i prepared my first energy gel i packed some based on both recommendations by experienced runners in my running club and experiences of bottoming out during long slow runs at the 145 mark when ive had nothing to eat prior to the run as i saw the water station in the distance i cracked the gel open sucked it down and washed whatever was left with water and gatorade 

im pretty sure that i was starting to feel some fatigue during the second half of the run but i realized that i still felt fine overall i felt that i could keep going and going until the finish and finishing felt more viable at that point than it did a week ago 

 race 15km to finish
looking back i made what couldve been a critical mistake during this leg i was able to see part of the finishing venue seoul world cup stadium in the distance and in my mind i was thinking its almost the end i started to pick up my pace and cracked open a second gel the problem was that i was at the 15 or 16km mark when i saw the stadium i forgot in that moment that we need to run an additional 2km or so past the stadium before we turn around and head back to the stadium 

because of this mistake this was when i could really feel the fatigue set in this was also when my mind was like fuck wheres the finish line fuck wheres the finish line fuck wheres the finish line it also didnt help that in the home stretch i tripped on a road reflector and stubbed my toe but was able to keep running until i finally crossed the finish line 

 postrace
there was a lot of wobbling and a lot of limping as i picked up my medal and food pack from race volunteers and stood in line to take commemorative photos in front of the event signs dinner was a very hearty homemade irish stew courtesy of my spouse right now 24 hours or so after the race my stubbed toe feels okay and my legs arent as numb as they were yesterday that said im not running for the next few days at the very least though i wouldnt turn down a walk or two as i get some errands taken care of 

 whats next
as mentioned i was going to run a marathon in early june but the injury if you can call it that and other nonrunning factors have made that not possible since its going to be hot and humid all summer as it always has been i think my first stab at a marathon will be in either september for the cherwon dmz marathonhttpwwwdmzrunkr or october for the chuncheon marathonhttpsmarathonchosuncomenglishindex01phpsearchbyinfo a side note despite the name dmz marathon the majority of the course is on nonrestricted roads 

besides that i may take part in at least one more halfmarathon and another 10k i probably should take part in a 5k though as my resolution for 2019 is to run a 5k 10k half marathon and full marathon at least once each

 preamble  training

i thought that you guys might be interested in this race report because i ran a marathon with virtually no training so five months after the fact here i am writing it up

as a bit of background i go to school in the philadelphia area and sort of on a whim decided to sign up for the marathon in the fall ive run a few half marathons before and i ran cross country for a few years in high school so i was pretty confident in my ability to perform well but the problem is i really hate training so essentially i just decided not to train for it

maybe thats a bit of an exaggeration my training consisted of one or two runs per week for the 12 weeks leading up to the race most of my runs ranged from 6 miles to 12 and the longest i went was a 16 mile run so i got in a good twenty or so training runs but i dont think i did more than 20 miles in a week even once plus i really hate running in the cold so for the month or so leading up to the race—when it started to get cold out—i was really just doing one run per week even with this little amount of training though i got to the point where i felt relatively fine after a 12 mile run so i was pretty confident going into the race

in the back of my mind i thought that on a completely perfect day i had it in me to run a sub 305 but i knew that was a long shot my more reasonable goal was sub 315 of course—as youre about to see—i gravely underestimated how hard it would be to keep up any sort of reasonable pace during the back half

 race miles 113

my plan going in to the race was to try to run a 7 minutemile pace for the first half and then see how long i could hang on to any semblance of a fast pace for the second half ideally i wanted to come through the first half at about 132 but i would have let myself go under 130 if i had really been feeling good it turned out that i did exactly as planned coming through the first half at a tad under 132 although my miles were getting slower i wasnt too concerned as i crossed the halfway point actually i felt pretty good considering id just run 13 miles and i definitely expected that around now i would have to slow down to a pace closer to 8 minutesmile anyway so far so good

 race miles 1316

these were the last miles where i was still pushing myself to speed up i was still feeling okay at this point but i had a sense that things were about to go downhill and to be honest i dont know what i expected i have never run more than 16 miles in my life so i was reaching the limit of what i was familiar with after mile 16 i fell off a cliff so to speak

 race miles 1623

for some reason i thought that my race would go like this 7 minute pace for a while and then 730 pace for a while and then 8 minute pace for a while and then maybe 9 minute pace at the very end and then i would be done but the thing is the intermediate pace never really came i went straight from 7 minute pace to 9 minute pace over the course of only like four miles miles 1623 were terrible at this point i really didnt even care what pace i was going it actually wasnt even in the back of my mind all i wanted to do was stop and not even finish necessarily i just wanted to stop the problem is the second half of the philadelphia marathon course is virtually out and back so the turnaround is at mile 20 or so around mile 17 i strongly considered dropping out but i continued to push off the decision until the point came where i literally would have been done quicker if i just kept running it was pretty cold out and i knew that the cold and disappointing four mile walk back to the startfinish line would take forever and maybe be almost as miserable as just finishing the race so i kept running i also knew that i couldnt start walking because i figured the second i stopped to walk i would cramp up and there was no way i would be able to start running again it was terrible all i wanted to do was drink a gallon of gatorade

 race miles 23262

for the last couple of miles it got easier in a way at this point as a selfdefense mechanism i had just shut off all emotions i was sort of just numb to everything definitely not physically numb but emotionally numb needless to say i didnt care about what time i got anymore i just wanted it to end

 post race

i finished and stood at the hydration station and drank like ten cups of gatorade back to back and then i lay down on the grass for maybe a half an hour very cold and unable to move and then i walked home ridiculously slowly all in all i was proud of the race as a mental feat but not as much as a physical feat my times in shorter distances would definitely predict that i should be running faster than a 330 marathon

for the next two days i pretty much couldnt walk im not exaggerating i thought i would never be able to walk again at one point i set out to get a protein shake from a place a quarter of a mile away and then turned back around after fifty steps or so realizing that there was no possible way i could make it that far but after a few more days i was fine the race was on a sunday and that thursday i jogged a thanksgiving 8k with a friend at about 8 minute pace and felt ok

trainingi thought that you guys might be interested in this race report because i ran a marathon with virtually no training so five months after the fact here i am writing it upas a bit of background i go to school in the philadelphia area and sort of on a whim decided to sign up for the marathon in the fall ive run a few half marathons before and i ran cross country for a few years in high school so i was pretty confident in my ability to perform well but the problem is i really hate training so essentially i just decided not to train for itmaybe thats a bit of an exaggeration my training consisted of one or two runs per week for the 12 weeks leading up to the race most of my runs ranged from 6 miles to 12 and the longest i went was a 16 mile run so i got in a good twenty or so training runs but i dont think i did more than 20 miles in a week even once plus i really hate running in the cold so for the month or so leading up to the race—when it started to get cold out—i was really just doing one run per week even with this little amount of training though i got to the point where i felt relatively fine after a 12 mile run so i was pretty confident going into the racein the back of my mind i thought that on a completely perfect day i had it in me to run a sub 305 but i knew that was a long shot my more reasonable goal was sub 315 of course—as youre about to see—i gravely underestimated how hard it would be to keep up any sort of reasonable pace during the back half race miles 113my plan going in to the race was to try to run a 7 minutemile pace for the first half and then see how long i could hang on to any semblance of a fast pace for the second half ideally i wanted to come through the first half at about 132 but i would have let myself go under 130 if i had really been feeling good it turned out that i did exactly as planned coming through the first half at a tad under 132 although my miles were getting slower i wasnt too concerned as i crossed the halfway point actually i felt pretty good considering id just run 13 miles and i definitely expected that around now i would have to slow down to a pace closer to 8 minutesmile anyway so far so good race miles 1316these were the last miles where i was still pushing myself to speed up i was still feeling okay at this point but i had a sense that things were about to go downhill and to be honest i dont know what i expected i have never run more than 16 miles in my life so i was reaching the limit of what i was familiar with after mile 16 i fell off a cliff so to speak race miles 1623for some reason i thought that my race would go like this 7 minute pace for a while and then 730 pace for a while and then 8 minute pace for a while and then maybe 9 minute pace at the very end and then i would be done but the thing is the intermediate pace never really came i went straight from 7 minute pace to 9 minute pace over the course of only like four miles miles 1623 were terrible at this point i really didnt even care what pace i was going it actually wasnt even in the back of my mind all i wanted to do was stop and not even finish necessarily i just wanted to stop the problem is the second half of the philadelphia marathon course is virtually out and back so the turnaround is at mile 20 or so around mile 17 i strongly considered dropping out but i continued to push off the decision until the point came where i literally would have been done quicker if i just kept running it was pretty cold out and i knew that the cold and disappointing four mile walk back to the startfinish line would take forever and maybe be almost as miserable as just finishing the race so i kept running i also knew that i couldnt start walking because i figured the second i stopped to walk i would cramp up and there was no way i would be able to start running again it was terrible all i wanted to do was drink a gallon of gatorade race miles 23262for the last couple of miles it got

 training
i initially signed up for the dexterann arbor half marathon that is scheduled in june but it turned out that i will be traveling on that day so i signed up for this race also i used hal higdons novice half marathon training plan and managed to stick to the schedule mostly i prefer running outside but the winter in michigan this year was so weird so some days i had to run on a treadmill due to iceintense cold to avoid myself from getting bored on the treadmill i trained myself to play fifa on my xbox while i run overall my training was done 90 outside and 10 inside i managed to pace my long runs so that i can keep the same splits throughout and i got pretty good at it 

 prerace
i had a quick breakfast of cereal with almond milk the start line was a short 5 min car ride away it was a frosty 29 degree morning i lined up with the 2 hour pacer 

 race
miles 14 the start was understandably crowded and i had trouble adjusting to running with so many people around me i guess i could have never trained for this unless i was part of a running club i kept running into other people as did others into me i was feeling pretty good about my pace i was wary of starting too fast so running with the 2 hour pacer helped with this but the crowd was getting annoying so i broke away from the 2 hour pacer after the 2 mile mark and never saw this group again i trusted myself to keep my pace reasonable the 4th mile brought with it a considerable downhill and it was hard to keep myself from running myself too fast my awesome wife was cheering for me for near the end of the 4th mile and it gave me a psychological boost 

miles 58 this part of the race runs along huron river in geddes park and it was so serene and pretty in the morning light some people were stopping and taking pictures overall i was feeling good since the track was flat and the crowd around me had thinned out comfortably i had the first of my larabars after mile 7 and inadvertently dropped my glove while enjoying my bar thankfully a girl behind me picked it up and handed it to me my super awesome wife had now driven to a small crowd gathered around mile 8 and i gave her a quick kiss and continued my run 

miles 9131 these miles once again took us inside the university of michigan and this was the worst part of the run since there were 2 considerably heavy hills i maintained my pace for the first one in the 11th mile but the second one in mile 12 was brutal and many runners around me started walking i decided to have my second larabar instead and kept pushing it was slow but i ran and never stopped to walk i was still feeling good after the hills were done and the last mile was flat so i pushed through once i saw the finish line i picked up my pace and ended strong i was elated that i finished 6 minutes under my goal my wife was at the finish line cheering for me again 

 postrace
i got my medal and a bottle of water and gulped it down also grabbed an ice cream sandwich and we headed to ihop for a brunch i wolfed down a hashbrown and pair of potato pancakes to replenish my calories overall it was a lot of fun and i told my wife that i will probably do another half around fall

 c  beat 21 minutes  yes 
 d  beat my 2007 pb 2040  yes 

 background

in 2007 at the age of 23m my goal was to beat 20 minutes in the 5 k i even got pretty close 2040 but then running went on the back burner as i finished up school moved to toronto and focused on other things for whatever reason my running turned into just the occasional jog to complement other exercise

then something happened on june 1st of last year i was on vacation in spain and went out for a jog as normal but as the run progressed it started feeling better and better instead of feeling like a chore like “exercise” running just felt wonderful again after coming home i found myself out for a 10 k jog longer than my usual then another 10 k later than week and another… i couldnt get enough 

maybe it had something to do with some diet changes that year but all i knew is i was loving running again i kept at it and a couple months later i signed up for my first 5 k in 10 years it was time to finally slay that 20 minute dragon

i knew it was going to take some time my first race in september got me to 2225httpswwwredditcomradvancedrunningcomments9muriufirst5kin10yearsracereport my second in november was 2157httpswwwredditcomrrunningcomments9wjwpxracereportrace2onmyroadtowardsa20minute and my third on december 30 was about 2140httpswwwredditcomrrunningcommentsadot11racereportbadbettergoodrace3towardsa20 despite some foot challenges i was pleased with the progress and my rediscovered love of the whole process—the plan building the supplemental exercises readingpodcasts about running rrunning—but what i was really looking forward to was an actual pb itd been a while and that brings me to this race…

 training
this was my fourth training period since i started up running again and it was the most varied and interesting training period so far it was winter and a cold one here in toronto there were –25° c long runs clambering over my first snow dunes and a rediscovery of the treadmill there’s a lot to lovehttpswwwredditcomrrunningcommentsaulmxdsomeloveforthehumbletreadmill pretty much every outdoor run had ice and snow to navigate i also really tried to focus on the act of running itself i mostly just listened to a metronome when i ran 180 bpm with a bit of music here and there

here are the specifics

 10 weeks  1 taper week 4–5 runs a week and 0–1 gym trips
 start at 30 kpw 19 mpw and increase at no more than 5 on average trying to avoid any more foot issues ended up with an average of 34 kpw 21 kpw including an unexpected week off in week 10 due to throat virus  foot issue
 lmhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgjo7mirlkulshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkorxbhgzzje before each run and samshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv1xqzb9eqr9qindex5listpluzqplveqwhfdfhae0qer5ixabddinml every day
 monday rest day
 tuesday tempo run i started doing this on the treadmill and really started to love it 10 minute warmup jog and then 20 minutes at tempo pace aiming for 80 hrr
 wednesday easy run of 5–7 k 3–45 m
 thursday wildcard started with a gym workout for the first few weeks then an easy run for the next few weeks and then 5x1 k intervals for the last few weeks
 friday rest day
 saturday long run of 12–18 k 75–11 m
 sunday easy run of 5–12 k 3–75 m or gym

in terms of inspiration and learning i also read what i talk about when i talk about running by haruki murakami listened to a bunch of the morning shakeout and strength running podcasts and revisited sage and sandys videoshttpswwwyoutubecomuservo2maxproductions on form and training many times plus lots of rrunning of course

 race
as the tenth week of my 11 week training program came to a close i started getting sick—really sick i found myself in the emergency room one week before the race with a super high fever followed by several days of forced bed rest not what i had planned for my taper week

by midweek it hadnt really improved and i had pretty much counted myself out for the race on friday i felt well enough to try a jog but could barely muster 635 min  k 1036 min  m drained i tried again saturday and it was a little better but not by much but hey good enough to try the race 

the morning of the race finally arrived and i made my way downtown my big reflections from the last race were 1 minimize distracting tech and 2 study the route beforehand i stuck to just a stopwatch for pacing little chance of gps working downtown anyways and i also studied the route map alongside google maps making notes of the 500 m points to use for pacing it was an outandback course with one route variation depending which way you were going so i also found a friendly course guide to clarify last race had some midcourse confusion which i didnt want to repeat i was ready to go

after doing my lmhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgjo7mirlkulshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkorxbhgzzje and a couple long jogs i lined up in the corral roughly where i thought i should be… and then we were off my pace after the first 500 m looked fast so i slowed down a little the next 500 m was still a little faster than expected but it felt good i think this was the first outdoor run of the year without significant patches of snow or ice anywhere and it felt great to just let loose

even though i was ready to convince myself that 21 minutes would have been a success i really just wanted to pb itd been twelve years and with the exception of the last week my training this winter had been great as the race went on i was paying less and less attention to the specific pace just focusing on the run… and then finally i saw the finish line come up i had no idea what the time was but i pushed nice and hard till the end and got that oddly gratifying wave of nausea as i finally came to a stop 

i looked at my watch 2017 it was a pb i was so happy 

 reflections
 last summer when the idea for a 20 minute 5 k came up again i watched some videos on how to do it this onehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxfx2t4zyu9u in particular really resonated with me my big takeaway was to run a lot and dont push too hard most of the time the huge for me boost in weekly kilometres over the past nine months feels like its really starting to pay off
 i usually run and race with a metronome at 180 but this race i didnt it seems my fast running cadence is much faster than 180 bpm and the metronome just slows me down im not sure if that means my stride length is too short but ill be giving some more thought to this going ahead
 spending time with the route map and google maps was really helpful and so was talking with the route volunteers about any potentially confusing sections ill definitely do this again

 next planrace
the next race is in early may i think with the right training and no significant injuries i should be able to beat 20 minutes fingers crossed i also want to use this plan to experiment with some periodization so im starting with a couple weeks of mostly easy miles plus a tempo run and a long run each week then ill work in hills for a couple weeks and then end the plan with a few weeks of intervals replacing the hills i found the 5 x 1 k really helpful this past plan so ill likely do the same feedback welcome

,,,,,,"only my 8th run of the year as i suffered a calf strain in february which put me out for a month and ive subsequently been working my way back up to my normal distance around 1012km

im pretty self conscious coupled with what can be quite serious anxiety so my normal running routes are a graveyardpark across the road which doesnt see much foot traffic and a local forest park which if youre there early also doesnt have anyone there

anyway today i dragged my ass out of bed at 6am and went for my first ever run on public streets and what a run it was my last two runs were a 10km and an 11km averaging around 600km  this time i was aiming for 12km and just to keep a close enough pace

so i ran and i was feeling pretty great and then i hit 12km and i felt so good that i kept running  and ended up doing 19km in 20219

honestly if youd have told me two years ago  when even a 3km run was out of the question  that id be doing this then id probably still be laughing i was hoping to hit a halfmarathon distance but i started to feel a twinge in my calf  the same twinge id felt leading up to my calf strain  so i slowed it down and stopped im not even mad i didnt hit my revised target  i surpassed last weeks run by 8km and my previous best distance was a 15km last october so i even smashed that

time for a shower i think today feels like its going to be a great day

if you read this i appreciate it",26,0.73,jaykay06,Not a race report but I wanted to share as I'm pretty proud of this run.,,,only my 8th run of the year as i suffered a calf strain in february which put me out for a month and ive subsequently been working my way back up to my normal distance around 1012kmim pretty self conscious coupled with what can be quite serious anxiety so my normal running routes are a graveyardpark across the road which doesnt see much foot traffic and a local forest park which if youre there early also doesnt have anyone thereanyway today i dragged my ass out of bed at 6am and went for my first ever run on public streets and what a run it was my last two runs were a 10km and an 11km averaging around 600km  this time i was aiming for 12km and just to keep a close enough paceso i ran and i was feeling pretty great and then i hit 12km and i felt so good that i kept running  and ended up doing 19km in 20219honestly if youd have told me two years ago  when even a 3km run was out of the question  that id be doing this then id probably still be laughing i was hoping to hit a halfmarathon distance but i started to feel a twinge in my calf  the same twinge id felt leading up to my calf strain  so i slowed it down and stopped im not even mad i didnt hit my revised target  i surpassed last weeks run by 8km and my previous best distance was a 15km last october so i even smashed thattime for a shower i think today feels like its going to be a great dayif you read this i appreciate it

 background

the last time i ran a race was back in september 2014 i didnt really follow a training plan and was also 50lbs heavier i finished in 1hr19mins and was lucky to do so in january 2016 i started a journey to lose the weight and am now at my lowest adult weight of around 142lbs i wanted to challenge myself in the new year and my husband suggested training for a race would be a great way to lose those stubborn final pounds

 training

i went from running once a week usually a 5k on the treadmill so i wanted a gentle training plan rather than jumping into running 4 times a week i found one geared towards those who can already comfortably run a 5k it was an 8 week plan most weeks comprised of 3 runs and included a tempo run an interval run and a long run these ranged from 7k to 12k

training was going fine until i tweaked something in my left leg during my final 8k long run my taper week ended up just being a rest week and going into race day i was very worried that i wouldnt be able to get through the race at all

 prerace

we had to travel from north london to lee valley but the trains werent running properly  thank you weekend rail works it took around 90 minutes to get there via tube overground and uber as i was getting anxious to get there register use the loo etc i also popped some ibuprofen for my legs and was feeling good to go after the race briefing

the lee valley white water centre is where they held the kayaking events during the london 2012 olympics and it was a very cool venue great facilities including a cafe which was perfect for those who werent running

 race

one of my main worries was setting off too fast at the start and ruining my pacing or worse injuring my leg however i remained level headed and started at a pace just under 600km the race honestly flew by all of a sudden i had done 5k and was coasting just under 30 minutes i was feeling pretty confident that i would be able to reach my goal of finishing in under an hour once i hit 7km i was waiting for my legs to tire or something to give but i honestly felt great the weather was perfect the course was flat and my legs just kept going once i hit 8km i tried to push myself even further

as i rounded the corner for the finish i started my sprint finish  i was feeling pretty knackered by this point but a guy was shouting as his friend to push for a sprint and it worked on me did not work on his friend who promptly doubledover in agony

i finished with a time of 5811 better than i could have ever hoped for

 postrace

they were passing out bananas and water with the medals so i grabbed some found my husband and went to find a place to stretch out we also took some pictures on the olympic podiums which was awesome

my leg was definitely suffering but i knew i could rest for a few weeks once this race was out of the way it wasnt the prettiest training but the race went so well i cant help but be proud of my achievement

my next goal is to run a halfmarathon but ultimately i want to try to keep up my running fitness more generally once my leg has fully recovered i want to be a regular at parkrun and add some more run days to my routine

ive learned that i should have focused on adding some more cross training and a better postrun stretch

 training and preamble

this race was the runnit us meetup for 2019 so i registered mostly to meet and share laps with some awesome strangers training started the week after the marine corps marathon where i ran a pr of 358 i created a frankenplan based on the baa level 3 marathon plan but added in the additional time on my feet recommended in most firsttime ultra plans thus a typical long run might be 18 with 2 x 4 miles at mp then slow jog out to 35 hours i ran about 5055 miles across 56 days per week including a long run a track day and usually a midweek longish workout with tempo miles for crosstraining i did basic strength training hips core butt or hiit about 2x per week yoga once or twice per week and i bikecommute in good weather except when im late or lazy which isoften i also made sure to do a run of 50km in each month before the race eg nov dec jan which really helped me with the mental barrier of going past 262 coming from marathons each of these runs was a new distance pr in january i did my longest run of 36 miles running laps around the central park reservoir with a few other jackpot runners

 goals

since this was my first timed ultra and my distance pr was 36 miles my primary goal was just to have fun and move for 24 hours that said i wanted a time goal so i decided on 50 miles in 10 hours after that id see how i felt this seemed ambitious but doable based on how i felt after my december 50k and the 36 in nyc

 prerace

i ended up working 60 hour weeks the two weeks before the race so i arrived in vegas thursday night pretty exhausted as an upside this made sleeping very easy i stayed in an airbnb with a bunch of other teammates we did an easy 35 mile shakeout run to breakfast friday morning then went to packet pickup together friday afternoon the mood at packet pickup was excited but tense 24 hours started to feel incredibly intimidating first off it was freezing not literally but it felt that way  we got our first taste of just how cold and windy it would be second we got to see the 48hour runners who had started that morning and were looking pretty tired despite having 40 hours left to go i got a light dinner at a buffet vegas after all and went to bed early the next morning i packed all the layers i had with me ate some peanut butter toast and we headed off

 laps 18 miles 020

average mile pace 1105

total time elapsed 341

this section felt pretty comfy i knew ujontas and udocbad32 were planning on 50 in 10 so i stuck near them for pacing i made a few bathroom stops and tried to eat something every other lap although i wasnt as consistent as i shouldve been as others have said the runnit crew is incredible they were really fast about grabbing things so the runners didnt have to stop for long i started off without my handheld but it was heating up quickly so ukarmicbias kindly got it ready for me during lap 3 and i ended up carrying it the rest of the race another high point was when mr curfudgeon turned up in lap 4 or 5 since he had to fly in separately by 11 am it was hot enough that i got concerned about the heat and lack of shade but with sunscreen a hat and plenty of water i was fine i shared a lap with udebanddom somewhere in here and we chitchatted but mostly i was on my own or talking to people nearby everything was feeling good

 laps 914 miles 2035

average mile pace 1125

total time elapsed 632

by this point the laps began to get monotonous but i was still having a great time daydreaming being outside and cheering people my 50k pr was just over 6 hours during the selfsupported run in december to hit the goal of 50 in 10 i knew i needed to beat that thats what motivated me during this section and lap 12 30 miles ended up being my fastest of the day at some point in here mr curfudgeon told me that i was leading the 24hour womens race  the app was showing that i was in 2nd but the woman ahead of me was moving twice as fast since anyone dropping 6minute miles would’ve stuck out like a sore thumb it had become clear that she was a usatf runner listed in the wrong race their loops were shorter while placing wasnt one of my goals coming in it definitely provided extra motivation to keep moving i recalled reading something des linden said about her 2018 boston win that at one point she wasnt feeling great but decided that since she was in the lead pack she probably shouldnt quit yet

 laps 1520 miles 3550

average mile pace 1323

total time elapsed 953

once i hit 50k around 548 i slowed down a bit i was still running pretty comfortably but i was hanging around longer at the aid stations and generally taking longer to do things food started to not be that appetizing we were a bit wet from some rain which kept threatening to get worse but thankfully never did i hit a low point here and it wouldve been a good time for a pacer but they werent allowed until sundown however people kept encouraging me to keep moving and at some point i realized that even though i had slowed i could still get 50 in 10 by watch time if not in actual race time i sped up a bit and celebrated that briefly before realizing that my math was way off and i could actually do both ultimately i finished lap 20 at 95319 and achieved my a goal looking back passing the team tent and having them cheer me on knowing that if i kept running i would hit my goal was my favorite moment of the race i also had a brief thought that if i could keep on going a buckle was possible

 laps 2130 miles 5075

average mile pace 1659

total time elapsed 1658

long story short i couldnt keep running i didnt take any significant breaks in this section but i had to push to make the 50 in 10 and when i tried to slow jog after that i decided pretty quickly that a 24hour 100 was not in the cards oh well luckily my walking pace is pretty quick so even with almost 100 walking i was able to keep moving forward at a good clip i broke out pandora for a few laps which helped i also realized that even though i was slowing i was still keeping up with most people on the course and thus maintaining my lead i spent a lot of this section trying to find things to eat that were remotely appetizing  at one point i carried a mcdonald’s chicken sandwich around for an entire lap unsuccessfully trying to convince myself to eat it at some point usaitoriel told me that the main aid station had hot broth and noodles that warm broth was basically magic and i started picking up a cup every other lap

 laps 30end miles 75885

average mile pace 3116 including naps

total time elapsed 2400

by now it was 1 am and i had been running since 8 am the previous day the timed race format provided a new challenge here  i had no mileage goals left to meet i just needed to make it through the next 7 hours so i decided to kill an hour sleeping thinking back i dont think i needed the rest as much as i mentally couldn’t imagine going for 7 more hours again the crew was a lifesaver it was really really cold now and they were even colder since they werent moving still they made sure i had a warm sleeping bag and blankets after an hour napping mr curfudgeon woke me up and helped me get my shoes back on he kept saying you just have to keep moving  putting your shoes back on is the hardest thing you will do today and he was right so i got up and i kept moving slowly ummmlots walked with me for a few laps and kept me company around 4 am the aid station started putting out pancakes and they were honestly perfect  easy to move with hot gentle on the stomach at some point an aid station volunteer told me to take only one pancake so they didnt run out in retrospect this was completely reasonable but at the time i found it grievously offensive and i took two anyway

as the sun was just beginning to come up i laid down again for another 30 minute rest but this time i woke up before the alarm and felt honestly really invigorated it was light out i had about 90 minutes left and i knew that the end was in sight when i finished lap 34 the rd handed me a beanbag which we could drop into buckets at 05 mile increments in order to record partial laps i remember being very insulted by this since we had over an hour left  its 25 miles how slow do you think i am i was now on a selfrighteous mission to finish lap 35 and prove that i didnt need that beanbag that last full lap ended up being my fastest since 10 pm the night before i kept going now proudly beanbaginhand and uskfoto photographed me joyously throwing the beanbag into the 1 mile bucket only to realize that that was in fact the 15 mile bucket and the 1 mile bucket was about 200 yards ahead yes the course was weird mr curfudgeon ran back to fetch it while i powered on past the actual 1 mile mark and ended the day with 885 miles and unexpectedly 1st woman in the 24hour race

 lessons learned

my 24hour experience was incredible it sounds absurd but one of the things i reflected on after was that i cant remember the last time i went an entire day without looking at my phone or thinking about work i saw the sun set then rise again i got to run alongside some truly phenomenal athletes i spent a day outside in a beautiful part of the world with wonderful people living fully in the moment that was a really powerful thing

that said im going to focus on marathons for the near future im excited to crew for the team next time but for now im going to enjoy long runs of 18 miles rather than 30 miles if i ever do this again i need to keep figuring out nutrition my stomach didnt revolt on me and i was able to keep food down but i think that was more luck than anything else i thought i was fully prepared with clothes socks gear etc  i wasnt and if it werent for the rest of the team my race would have ended much earlier i also need to work on ways to keep my motivation up during the hard parts of the night the only thing i regret about this race was slowing down so dramatically after i hit 50 miles once i knew i had a lock on 1st but wouldnt make 100 it was hard to find reasons to keep moving

 gratitude

in summary i really cant speak enough about the incredible support that uthepsion and the rest of our crew provided uschizamm was a shining beacon of welcome in the darkest hours of the night ummmlots came back at night to pace instead of enjoying his wellearned rest after placing in the 6hour uahf0913 pointed out that i ought to change shoes and offered up a pair of her own during and after the race urunlowsky always knew what i needed warmer clothes drier clothes food water long before i did and gently bossed me around in the most helpful way during the night multiple people gave me their blankets even though they were certainly colder than i was i could name a dozen more examples of this it was stunning the amount of care and kindness they showed me particularly since im new to the team and only met these people in person 36 hours before it was an amazing day i won an ultramarathon hit my goals for the 50k and 50 mile and surpassed my previous distance pr by more than 50 miles that isnt something you do alone after the blisters and the soreness have passed what i will take from this experience is that to be cared for in that way by that many people is an incredibly powerful thing",200,0.95,curfudgeon,Race Report: Jackpot Ultra!

 training

i did pfitz 1855 after averaging around 40km pweek over summer on a 10k plan my original goal was around 315320 with a plan to adjust closer to the race depending how things went training went reasonably well i almost always had some kind of niggle but nothing that lasted more than a few days and i only missed 1 run in the first 13 weeks i hit all the paces without too much trouble but in hindsight probably pushed too hard considering ive only been running around 18 months and this was my first marathon and first time at this high mileage

i did a solo 15km time trial in week 12 in 5937 and 29km with 23km at goal mp pace the following week and i was starting to consider changing my goal to 305310 unfortunately those 2 weeks left me with peroneal tendonitis and i had to take 5 days off to let it heal after 5 days off and being sick with food poisoning the day before i stupidly decided to race a 10k tune up at 100 i got a very nice pb but in the process strained my lower backglute this is where pushing too hard the previous 3 months caught up to me i basically couldnt even walk or stand on one leg the following day but i was hoping it would be like the tendonitis or any of the other ninggles i had and it would pass with a little rest and no running for a few days

i quickly realised that wasnt going to happen so i started seeing a physio a couple times a week with 4 weeks to go it was looking like i might have to pull out i still couldnt walk without pain after 2 weeks and definitely couldnt run i was also overseas for work during this period so couldnt do any cross training i kept going to the physio and with 9 days to go i went for my first run made it 3km at a very slow pace very uncomfortable and was still thinking there was no way i can run 42 not even jogging a miserably slow pace i did a few more short runs 6km 10km and 8km and a bit of time on the elliptical went to the physio again on wednesday and it was still not looking good but id decided i wasnt going to miss this chance id walk if i had to

 prerace

flew into tokyo on thursday afternoon some more elliptical on fri morning and a 3km treadmill jog with a couple of faster strides just to see how a faster pace felt still pretty uncomfortable went to the expo on friday it was pretty uneventful got my bib with no line and got out of there pretty quickly saturday morning i did a short 4km jog outside and was suddenly feeling slightly better at this point i still had no clue what pace to aim for how much fitness id lost in the last 5 weeks or how long my glute would hold out i only slept about 5 hours friday night and 2 hours saturday night actually i slept pretty terrible the whole last 2 weeks combination of jet lag and stress about my injury ate a small breakfast of toast and oatmeal at 6am foam rolled and stretched got ready and headed down to the start around 730 im staying at park hyatt so only a few minutes walk got through the gate and bag check very quickly did a short 5min jog around 830 some light stretching and then got in my corral at 845 the weather was around 5 or 6 degrees celsius and light rain was falling i had on warm throwaway clothing and a poncho so it was all good

 race

id like to give an accurate description of each part of the race but honestly it was all a bit of a blur so ill just give some highlights i decided that since my training was showing 305 a month ago i decided to just go after my original goal of 315320 i was going to follow this plan for 315 httpsfeelracecomfrplds42hh03mm15ss00bt185unkthmarcopgexechttpsfeelracecomfrplds42hh03mm15ss00bt185unkthmarcopgexec  and just continually adjust and only push the pace depending how i felt

gun went off at 910 i was in coral e so took about 6 minutes of walking to get to the start line during which time i took off my throwaway clothes i wore shorts singlet arm sleeves gloves and beanie the first 1km was a bit of a shitshow i tried to stay on the edge of the road and was passing hundreds of people some already walking some that had b or c bibs but were clearly never going to race the estimated time they must have put in to start that far up i forgot to take my gel before the race so took it in the first km the first 5km i just tried to get in a rhythm and not go too fast but there was lots of slowing down and speeding up to find a gap to get past people tried to stay relaxed though long way to go

after 5km it started to open up there were still sections where i think it changed to one lane instead of 2 and it got a bit congested again but no major problems i drank pocari at the first aid station and then alternated water and pocari at the stations every 23km i took gu gels at 7km 15km 23km 27km and 32km the volunteers here were great standing in the rain and always offering support

gps was a little wonky as to be expected with that many people and tokyos buildings but i was using the race screen app for garmin which was amazing showing my pace for the last 10s and expected finish time based on average pace i did need to manually press the lap button every km some of which i missed and at one 1 pressed it twice which stressed me out for a second but i just tried to carry on

5km to 20km i was feeling pretty good i could feel the tightness in my glute and it was slightly uncomfortable but no pain my heart rate was super high the entire race i dont know if it was the lack of sleep the excitement or my garmin playing up but 420430km pace was feeling like easy pace easy breathing and i was feeling pretty comfortable the race screen app kept showing 10s pace of 440450 but every km i clicked off was 420430 i kept trying to slow down but it was easier to just go with the flow of a comfortable pace

the heaviness of the rain came and went there were some sections with some wind but overall i was never too cold i gradually took of my beanie around 20km my gloves around 27km and my arm sleeves around 32km i have to say as well the crowd support here was just phenomenal i was expecting there to be lots of people here and there but literally the whole 42195km the streets were lined sometimes 3 or 4 deep with people cheering support waving their hand made signs and giving high fives i honestly feel like they warmed me up and pushed me on it was amazing my wife managed to get to 6 locations to see me i only found her at 3 i think shes more exhausted than me today

after the half i was still feeling very comfortable but was nervous i was going too fast race screen had been showing sub 315 and even down to around 313 so i really made a conscious effort to slow down as you can see in the splits i had the plan to take it easy from the half to 32km and then push the pace for the last 10km and especially the last 5km if i had anything left by then

around 29km my cardio was still great but my calves started to feel heavy no pain just heavy tried to keep focused relaxed and get ready for the last 10 at 32km i was still feeling ok so i started to push maybe too much because it was the fastest km of the race 412 ok thats not going to happen so tried to slow down to 430km pace which if i held would might have been enough to get me under 315 sure i can run a sub 45 10k

this last 7km was a battle the rain was getting heavier the wind was getting stronger and my calves were starting to scream most likely due to not training for the last month i would have a good km and edge closer to 315 then a bad km and slip back over 316 then a couple of bad km and i was slipping towards 317 i was giving it everything i had feeling like i was running the fastest i had the whole race and then clock a 449km with 3km to go i must have looked ridiculous i could hardly lift my legs of the ground i think i was waddle running like a duck with my head down pushing as hard as possible as i saw my time edging towards 317 i was passing people left and right people walking people stretching people bent over people with medical staff people almost running backwards like they literally had nothing left to give i cant be one of them i have to be under 317 the last 2km it felt like the rain got even heavier it was really a blur and then i saw what i realised was the last corner and 200 metres to go head down again and pushed for the finish 31649

 postrace

immediately after the finish is the only complaint id have i had to walk about 15mins in the freezing wind and rain before getting a towel and heat wrap by which point i was absolutely shivering to the bone i think thats the only thing they could improve picked up my bag got changed and met up with my wife for yakiniku and beer then hobbled onto the subway back to the hotel for an ice bath a warm bath and a rest

this was just the most amazing experience of my life im so grateful to have had the chance im incredibly relieved i was even able to start given my condition even 3 or 4 days ago but to meet my original goal with those circumstances makes me feel so happy im a very negative person in general and i guess thats the thing ive learned from this is to always stay positive and just keep going

 background  
10 years ago i finished my enlistment in the army i was in good shape while i served and always did well on pt tests i joined when i was 19 and got out when i was 22  at the time i could do the 2 mile run just shy of 13 minutes  we did one really slow pace run as a unit that was about 8 miles great aloha run in hawaii but we seldom ran more than 5 miles during regular training  

over the last ten years i did a couple of 5k races and tried to get into running several times but i never stuck with it  the most i got up to was about 10 miles

in november of last year i decided to sign up for this carmel marathon and see if i could complete it  i had a feeling i would be more committed once i signed up for something and i was right 

x200b

 training  
heres my monthly mileage leading up to this 

jansept  0 miles

october  16 miles

november 34 miles

december 97 miles

january 106 miles

february 143 miles

march 94 miles 120 miles if you count the actual marathon march 30

x200b

i looked at several training plans including higdons galloway and others and basically decided to form my own simpler plan  i did shorter faster runs 34 times during the week and a long run every weekend 

most of my long runs were between 910 minute pace shorter runs would be anywhere from high 6 minute pace to 9 minute pace 

x200b

the first long run that i tried to run 13 miles but legs went completely dead and i only made it 1185  i took a couple days off of running and tried again and hit 13 miles barely

x200b

when i went out for my first 20 mile run i only made it to 19 and gave up  i ended up doing about 4 20milers and they were all a struggle  i went out too fast on a couple of them and learned from that mistake  

x200b

3 weeks before the marathon i got sick and took 6 days off of running then 2 weeks before the marathon i was out on my last 20 miler and started getting sharp shooting pains behind my right knee  i ended up running 12 that day and walking 4 more miles back home  i took another 5 days off running and went to a physical therapist  she said it was medial hamstring tendonitis and that i needed to stretch my hamstrings more before and after runs  i was pretty worried at this point that i wasnt going to be able to finish the marathon after missing so much training  fortunately i was able to get a couple 57 milers in at an easy pace during the end of my taper and i didnt experience the pain nearly as bad  that sort of boosted my confidence back up some because i was so paranoid that this knee was going to give me problems on race day   


 prerace  
i live 15 hours from carmel so my wife kids and i went up the night before and stayed with her parents who live about 2 miles away from the race  i ate a lot of spaghetti and other carbs the night before did yoga with my wife and went to bed about 9 pm  i had my running gear all laid out and ready to roll for the morning  the weather called for 100 chance of rain and low 50 degree weather so i turned up a disposable poncho to bring with me for the first few miles 

x200b

i slept pretty poorly that night  i got up about 6am had a cup of coffee banana and a kind bar  went to the restroom then did a few more stretches and called an uber for a ride  i could have walked two miles to the start line but i didnt want to waste any energy that i might need to finish the marathon 

  


 race  
when i got to the race it was cold windy and raining  it was about 730 am and we were set to start at 8 am  there were supposed to be approximately 4000 runners and there were maybe 40 porta potties at most by the starting location  i made it to the porta potty line about 20 minutes before the race was to start and really hoped id be able to drain my bladder before we took off  i was chatting with people in line and next thing i know its 8am and people just abandoned the lines and ran towards the starting corrals i decided to go ahead and use the restroom real quick since i waited so long and then i ran towards the start line  

on my way to the start line i landed in a huge puddle and completely soaked both of my feet  it was pretty annoying but i put vaseline all over my feet beforehand because i read it would really help with running in the rain to prevent blisters  id definitely recommend doing that because it worked great    


when i got to the corral the crowd was so thick that i got stuck at the back and wasnt successful working my way forward very far when i finally crossed the start line i was next to the 5 hour and something pace group and couldnt see the 355 pacer any where in sight

i weaved around people and finally caught up to the 4 hour pace group around the 2 mile marker i ran about a mile with the 4 hour group but it felt pretty slow to me after going above pace to catch up to them  i decided to speed up slightly and catch the 355 pacer i think it took maybe another mile or less to catch the 355 pacer and i ran with them for several miles 

x200b

somewhere around mile 5 the rain eased up a bit and i decided to ditch my poncho  however the rain was far from done  also i forgot to mention i wore a nathan running vest with a water bladder built in  but i only filled it about 12 way to reduce the weight  i mainly brought it so i would have something to hold my gu because i dont like wearing belts or fanny packs 

x200b

my wife was supposed to meet me at mile 12 so a couple miles before i decided to speed up a little so i could say hi to her and the kids and then take back off with the pace group when they caught up to me  but when i got to our rendezvous point she wasnt there  i told her i would be running 900910 pace so she had timed it out to where she would get there just a minute or two before me and not have to stand in the rain long with the kids but since i was ahead of schedule i later found out that she missed me by just a couple minutes

x200b

at mile 14 i was still moving along fine and was counting my blessings that my knee wasnt hurting at all then i came around a corner and saw my wife and kids  when she realized she missed me she drove up a couple miles to catch me at another point  i stopped and hugged the girls for about 5 seconds and then took back off 

x200b

from mile 14  21 i kept waiting for my knee to start giving me problems or to hit the wall but it never came  i had taken gu at mile 5 10 14 and 19 and was feeling good 

x200b

then from mile 2224 my legs started feeling heavier and i slowed down a hair  but when i saw the 24 mile sign i smiled and knew that i had this  so i picked my pace back up and ran strong to the finish line 

x200b

it was an awesome experience and i feel super grateful that my injury didnt flare up and i didnt even hit the wall  the weather was terrible but being out there with other runners and spectators in the rain made it so much more bearable  i had the pleasure of chatting with several really nice people during the race and i couldnt believe how much everyone tries to pick each other up with positivity 

 postrace  
met the family at the finish line and we grabbed a quick picture together  after that we pretty much headed straight to the car to get the girls out of the rain  oddly enough when i first finished the only part of my body that was sore was my left shoulder  who knows 

when i got back to my inlaws house i started feeling a lot more stiff in my legs just from sitting in the car for 15 minutes  i took an epson salt bath which really helped  i ate some food and took a nap

today my hamstrings are pretty sore quads calves and feet feel fine for the most part   i did a little yoga and some other stretching this morning and plan to do the same tonight    


 whats next  
i signed up for a local half marathon this saturday 1 week after marathon  i plan on zero running until the half on saturday  im not looking to run it in any specific time frame so if im too sore i plan on just taking it easy

x200b

i have a brother who runs ultras and i would like to one day do a long race with him  but ive only had a marathon under my belt for a day so im not jumping into any crazy in the near future 

x200b

so allinall im really happy i did this marathon  i was super nervous about not doing a half marathon first but the 20 mile long runs really helped overcome that anxiety  if i were to do anything different it would have been to increase my mileage less drastically each week to avoid injury  i also think i would have benefited from 6 months of easy running to build a better base  but it all worked out in the end and im super fortunate and really proud of accomplishing this 

x200b

lastly big shout out to this forum and others for all the positive and informing posts  i found a lot of information on reddit that helped me achieve this goal

seldom ran more than 5 miles during regular training  over the last ten years i did a couple of 5k races and tried to get into running several times but i never stuck with it  the most i got up to was about 10 milesin november of last year i decided to sign up for this carmel marathon and see if i could complete it  i had a feeling i would be more committed once i signed up for something and i was right x200b training  heres my monthly mileage leading up to this jansept  0 milesoctober  16 milesnovember 34 milesdecember 97 milesjanuary 106 milesfebruary 143 milesmarch 94 miles 120 miles if you count the actual marathon march 30x200bi looked at several training plans including higdons galloway and others and basically decided to form my own simpler plan  i did shorter faster runs 34 times during the week and a long run every weekend most of my long runs were between 910 minute pace shorter runs would be anywhere from high 6 minute pace to 9 minute pace x200bthe first long run that i tried to run 13 miles but legs went completely dead and i only made it 1185  i took a couple days off of running and tried again and hit 13 miles barelyx200bwhen i went out for my first 20 mile run i only made it to 19 and gave up  i ended up doing about 4 20milers and they were all a struggle  i went out too fast on a couple of them and learned from that mistake  x200b3 weeks before the marathon i got sick and took 6 days off of running then 2 weeks before the marathon i was out on my last 20 miler and started getting sharp shooting pains behind my right knee  i ended up running 12 that day and walking 4 more miles back home  i took another 5 days off running and went to a physical therapist  she said it was medial hamstring tendonitis and that i needed to stretch my hamstrings more before and after runs  i was pretty worried at this point that i wasnt going to be able to finish the marathon after missing so much training  fortunately i was able to get a couple 57 milers in at an easy pace during the end of my taper and i didnt experience the pain nearly as bad  that sort of boosted my confidence back up some because i was so paranoid that this knee was going to give me problems on race day    prerace  i live 15 hours from carmel so my wife kids and i went up the night before and stayed with her parents who live about 2 miles away from the race  i ate a lot of spaghetti and other carbs the night before did yoga with my wife and went to bed about 9 pm  i had my running gear all laid out and ready to roll for the morning  the weather called for 100 chance of rain and low 50 degree weather so i turned up a disposable poncho to bring with me for the first few miles x200bi slept pretty poorly that night  i got up about 6am had a cup of coffee banana and a kind bar  went to the restroom then did a few more stretches and called an uber for a ride  i could have walked two miles to the start line but i didnt want to waste any energy that i might need to finish the marathon    race  when i got to the race it was cold windy and raining  it was about 730 am and we were set to start at 8 am  there were supposed to be approximately 4000 runners and there were maybe 40 porta potties at most by the starting location  i made it to the porta potty line about 20 minutes before the race was to start and really hoped id be able to drain my bladder before we took off  i was chatting with people in line and next thing i know its 8am and people just abandoned the lines and ran towards the starting corrals i decided to go ahead and use the restroom real quick since i waited so long and then i ran towards the start line  on my way to the start line i landed in a huge puddle and completely soaked both of my feet  it was pretty annoying but i put vaseline all over my feet beforehand because i read it would really help with running in the rain to prevent blisters  id definitely recommend doing that because it worked great    when i got to the corral the crowd was so thick that i got stuck at the back and wasnt successful working my way forward very far when i finally crossed the start line i was next to the 5 hour and something pace group and couldnt see the 355 pacer any where in sighti weaved around people and finally caught up to the 4 hour pace group around the 2 mile marker i ran about a mile with the 4 hour group but it felt pretty slow to me after going above pace to catch up to them  i decided to speed up slightly and catch the 355 pacer i think it took maybe another mile or less to catch the 355 pacer and i ran with them for several miles x200bsomewhere around mile 5 the rain eased up a bit and i decided to ditch my poncho  however the rain was far from done  also i forgot to mention i wore a nathan running vest with a water bladder built in  but i only filled it about 12 way to reduce the weight  i mainly brought it so i would have something to hold my gu because i dont like wearing belts or fanny packs x200bmy wife was supposed to meet me at mile 12 so a couple miles before i decided to speed up a little so i could say hi to her and the kids and then take back off with the pace group when they caught up to me  but when i got to our rendezvous point she wasnt there  i told her i would be running 900910 pace so she had timed it out to where she would get there just a minute or two before me and not have to stand in the rain long with the kids but since i was ahead of schedule i later found out that she missed me by just a couple minutesx200bat mile 14 i was still moving along fine and was counting my blessings that my knee wasnt hurting at all then i came around a corner and saw my wife and kids  when she realized she missed me she drove up a couple miles to catch me at another point  i stopped and hugged the girls for about 5 seconds and then took back off x200bfrom mile 14  21 i kept waiting for my knee to start giving me problems or to hit the wall but it never came  i had taken gu at mile 5 10 14 and 19 and was feeling good x200bthen from mile 2224 my legs started feeling heavier and i slowed down a hair  but when i saw the 24 mile sign i smiled and knew that i had this  so i picked my pace back up and ran strong to the finish line x200bit was an awesome experience and i feel super grateful that my injury didnt flare up and i didnt even hit the wall  the weather was terrible but being out there with other runners and spectators in the rain made it so much more bearable  i had the pleasure of chatting with several really nice people during the race and i couldnt believe how much everyone tries to pick each other up with positivity  postrace  met the family at the finish line and we grabbed a quick picture together  after that we pretty much headed straight to the car to get the girls out of the rain  oddly enough when i first finished the only part of my body that was sore was my left shoulder  who knows when i got back to my inlaws house i started feeling a lot more stiff in my legs just from sitting in the car for 15 minutes  i took an epson salt bath which really helped  i ate some food and took a naptoday my hamstrings are pretty sore quads calves and feet feel fine for the most part   i did a little yoga and some other stretching this morning and plan to do the same tonight     whats next  i signed up for a local half marathon this saturday 1 week after marathon  i plan on zero running until the half on saturday  im not looking to run it in any specific time frame so if im too sore i plan on just taking it easyx200bi have a brother who runs ultras and i would like to one day do a long race with him  but ive only had a marathon under my belt for a day so im not jumping into any crazy in the near future x200bso allinall im really happy i did this marathon  i was super nervous about not doing a half marathon first but the 20 mile long runs really helped overcome that anxiety  if i were to do anything different it would have been to increase my mileage less drastically each week to avoid injury  i also think i would have benefited from 6 months of easy running to build a better base  but it all worked out in the end and im super fortunate and really proud of accomplishing this x200blastly big shout out to this forum and others for all the positive and informing posts  i found a lot of

 training  
i run cross country and track for my high school  that takes priority over training for this race as this was just something fun to do with my dad i am focusing on the 800 this season because of an it band injury that took me out of the indoor track season for 3 weeks so i was missing the base that i would need to run the 3200 and the 1600 as well as i could i mostly have been running 3 to 4 miles daily with the occasional 5 and my long run for this season has just been 6 miles i was nervous about running this as it is 4 miles further than i have run all season but i also really wanted to be able to share this experience with my dad once before college as it is his favorite race to run he has ran it 9 times now over 11 years  


 race strategy  
i just wanted to enjoy running around the most beautiful part of dc and to not go too fast and risk getting hurt and ending my senior track season early 

x200b

 prerace  
the day before the race i had a track meet i was running the 800 and i ended up getting a pr of 207 which was good to run this early in the season so i am on track for my goal of a 204 for those of you that have never ran an 800 it hurts a lot as you are pretty much sprinting for the whole half mile i was fairly sore as i usually am after a track meet but i still felt pretty good after i got a nice cool down and stretch in i went to bed around 1030 and woke up at 530 had a bowl of oatmeal and me and my dad drove down to dc for the race we got there about a half an hour before the start and it was packed there were about 18000 people racing so this was very new to me as the most people i had raced with is about 200 in a cross country 5k we got to the starting line i did a quick jog and stretch and then jumped into the starting area  


 mile 1  
i told my dad i would run the first mile with him before going our separate ways so that is exactly what i did i did take a quick trip to the portapotties which resulted in me opening the door on someone please if you are going to the bathroom put the lock on the door so the outside turns red and then caught up to him we talked some and enjoyed the views but i could tell he was struggling to keep up and he also felt bad for holding me back so at the mile we said our goodbyes gave each other a fist bump and then i was off  


 miles 2 to 6  
the second mile was pretty boring i had to pass tons of people and had very little room to run normally the second mile goes over the memorial bridge but since it is under construction currently they made a slight change to the course so we ended up running on a highway and got to go under watergate but other than that it was anticlimatic the next few miles were fantastic it was absolutely beautiful running by the cherry blossoms over the tidalbasin and next to the national mall i lost track of my pace i was trying to run 830800 mile pace and ended up speeding up a bit but i felt great the entire time i passed 2 guys wearing blow up panda suits here is a photo my dad got of them before the racehttpsimgurcomvdqiec4   


 miles 6 to 10  
this part of the race was absolutely beautiful once again just running along the potomac with the cherry blossoms everywhere was just amazing i really never realized just how beautiful of a city dc is despite living just outside of it my entire life i still had very little room to run as there were just so many people in the race the result website said that i passed roughly 1500 people while racing with less than 150 passing me so i am pretty happy with that result but it also highlights just how packed this race was we did a quick turnaround and started running back towards the finish line which is right at the washington monument i remember looking up and seeing the beautiful monument through some of the cherry blossoms which i thought was amazing i just wish i had gotten a picture suddenly i am at mile 9 feeling way better than i though i would have considering my low mileage season so far and running much faster than i had initially planned i thought i might as well make this last one my best mile and also not let anyone pass me so that is exactly what i did i dropped the pace down to 700 and didnt let anyone pass me i crossed through the finish line with the biggest smile on my face and still felt fantastic i honestly feel like i could have either ran 600 pace the entire time or ran a second 10 mile at that pace   


 postrace  
after finishing i got some water a banana and a nice space blanket to keep me warm it was still pretty chilly about 50 degrees same as the start which felt amazing when running but was a bit cold for just waiting around in nothing but a  singlet shorts and some arm sleeves i got some of the food some coffee and my medal i then sat down ate my food and drank my water and coffee stretched and waited for the next 30 minutes for my dad to finish we took some pictures of ourselves with our medals then left the city ate a cheesecake factory and went home for a nice 3 hour nap

beautiful monument through some of the cherry blossoms which i thought was amazing i just wish i had gotten a picture suddenly i am at mile 9 feeling way better than i though i would have considering

training

at the end of 2018 i was unfit and a borderline alcoholic new year new me as my unbearable sister would say but i cut right back on the drinking cut down on the carbs and started working out regularly after a couple of months of good weight loss 7kgs i went to the physical training instructor at work and asked for some advice on getting fitter we discussed goals where i decided that running was my favorite part of the week and i wanted to run a marathon she worked out a plan to have me running a marathon in feb next year

x200b

sticking to the plan has been easy started with 5kms every second day and is now at 10 km mon wed fri and a long slow run 2 hrs on sunday in between is short strength workouts for core and upper body with some lunges and squats for power there has been some hard times as i travel a lot for work and getting timeplace to run in some of the random places i end up ive found skipping is a great replacement for those times

x200b

pre race

another fella i work with is a good long distance runner we discussed different strategies for the week leading up i rested more but didnt change my diet last night i had zugetti bolognaise and for breaky a nice swiss muesli i stretched for a good while the night before and a good warm up this morning

x200b

race

this is now my normal training distance so i knew how to pace myself and my body was used to the distance it was all down to pushing harder than usual and not worrying about target heart rates

x200b

02km paced with my running partner nice easy start and felt good focussed on technique and steering clear of the random movers in the pack

35 hit the very mild uphil section lifted the heels maintained the pace and passed most people in my starting group here breathing became more difficult and required more focus

68 metallicas sad but true came on m smashed this section second and steepest rise they arent really hills leading up to parliament house allowed me to pass quite a few other people here i fell into pace with a younger bloke which i held to the end

910 down hill i started working towards the final sprint the bloke i was pacing off started to fall back so i cheered him on we raced to the finish line for a handshake and a well done both ways finished feeling really good there was almost nothing left in the tank which makes me think i paced it out well

x200b

up next

i dont need much recovery as this was a standard distance ill be back into it on monday continuing the training plan i head to the uk for the second half of the year and will find a half marathon in octobernovember to participate in

training

i followed the pfitz 1855 this time around i did the hal higdon ones for my other marathons and i always had mixed results i have a dream of one day qualifying for boston so i figured i should start learning advanced running techniques before i try tackling the boston qualifier i learned a lot about speedwork my favorite vo2 max and checking your heart rate throughout runs did i follow the plan to the letter hell no but i did a damn good job making sure i felt confident going into the race the longest run i did prior to the marathon was a couple weeks prior a 20 miler i felt so strong and happy during that run that i knew as long as i kept myself healthy and injuryfree ill get through this marathon with a pr

to be honest ive always pooped out around mile 18 in every marathon ive ever done i also get cramps in my right hamstring right around mile 20 and its a tough slog to the end i like the feeling of digging deep and giving it all you got to the finish so i never realized that a proper training plan and nutrition during the race completely prevents this from happening inb4 someone calls me an idiot for not knowing this beforehand

more on this later

prerace

kept my routine exactly the same i ate a nice hearty meal of rice salmon broccoli veggie sausage and lots of water the night before the morning of i ate my regular bowl of oatmeal berries walnuts banana and peanut butter i live along the marathon route mile 6 in adams morgan so i figured id hop on the bike and make my way down to the mall around 635 for a 700am start time 

side note the ride down the mall when the roads are shut down was glorious hit every green light along the way and its totally downhill it was a serene way to begin the marathon day

race

so i cant say this rock and roll marathon was super well organized at least i couldnt find where anything was in the starting area and i couldnt be bothered to open up the map so i asked someone where the baggage drop off was and it was a bit of a walk away by the time i got to the bag dropoff line the national anthem was being butchered in the background and i knew i wouldnt make my corral corral 1 i didnt really care because the mall has some wide roads and ill have plenty of space to pass 

however finding parking for my bike was a bitch and i eventually found a tree who knows if its still there

so the marathon starts and im cruising along i decide for this marathon to trust my training and use my heart rate as a guide i choose to stay in the 120150 heart rate zone i know i can keep this up forever so i said fuck the pace and lets just do it live

i felt great miles flew by i saw my partner and my best friend in my neighborhood and ran along roads i know like the back of my hand i retraced the steps i had taken hundreds of times before little vignettes popped up in my mind of all the times i had been here this is where i ran after a hard emotional day and remembered the feeling of dried moisture on my face thats where i gave up on a 8 mile run because my pf was acting up and felt the shame of quitting thats where my dog always likes to shit during our runs 

we hit the half marathon mark and moved into anacostia a historically black and low income neighborhood i dont really know why the race organizers thought it was a good idea to run through this neighborhood dont get me wrong im not worried about any safety or anything but my reservations could be summed up by one woman who came out of her home looked at us running and shouted i wish i could run too but i cant you and your privilege  it was a sobering reminder of how lucky i was to be able to take a full saturday to run and enjoy my body something so many people in this country cannot afford to do 

anyway back to the run i kept waiting for the moment when my legs would start hurting like they usually do but it never came 13 14 15 flew by and still i felt fresh hot damn those hills in anacostia were no joke but i had trained on hills and they were a cake walk for me i chased the peaks i figured if i felt really good going into the half i would try to negative split this race something ive never done before miles 18 19 20 came still no discomfort 

at this point i knew this marathon was different the hours of running the careful nutrition ate a powerbar right at the half mark and the gulping of water w nuun in it was paying off if i was feeling good at 20 mind as well push it and get myself in that uncomfortable place i know so well i pushed into the 730 paces and boy were those tough at the end but my favorite sign 25 came around 

that last mile i clocked in at 722 and it did feel like horseshit at the time but man did i feel accomplished when i crossed that finish line

postrace

so what did i do differently this time around to feel so great honestly i think it was watching my waterelectrolyte intake and monitoring my heart rate throughout i was amazed to see how consistent my pace was through the entire thing as long as your heart rate stays the same going into further marathon training im might invest in a fancy watch or heart rate monitor and see how far i can take this new discovery 

anyways marathons really arent about the runners they are the spectacle but the true winners are all the families organizers volunteers policemenwomen and doggies out there on the course making sure we finish and achieve our dreams thats why i do marathons every year and its so hard to describe this experience to people who dont understand why people run its really not about the running its about the humanity that running brings out in others 

if i can find that once maybe twice a year  thats good enough for me

washington dc finish time 33803goalsgoal  description  completeda  pr  yupb  dont poop out around mile 18  oh yeahc  33000  nahd  have fun  loved ittrainingi followed the pfitz 1855 this time around i did the hal higdon ones for my other marathons and i always had mixed results i have a dream of one day qualifying for boston so i figured i should start learning advanced running techniques before i try tackling the boston qualifier i learned a lot about speedwork my favorite vo2 max and checking your heart rate throughout runs did i follow the plan to the letter hell no but i did a damn good job making sure i felt confident going into the race the longest run i did prior to the marathon was a couple weeks prior a 20 miler i felt so strong and happy during that run that i knew as long as i kept myself healthy and injuryfree ill get through this marathon with a prto be honest ive always pooped out around mile 18 in every marathon ive ever done i also get cramps in my right hamstring right around mile 20 and its a tough slog to the end i like the feeling of digging deep and giving it all you got to the finish so i never realized that a proper training plan and nutrition during the race completely prevents this from happening inb4 someone calls me an idiot for not knowing this beforehandmore on this laterpreracekept my routine exactly the same i ate a nice hearty meal of rice salmon broccoli veggie sausage and lots of water the night before the morning of i ate my regular bowl of oatmeal berries walnuts banana and peanut butter i live along the marathon route mile 6 in adams morgan so i figured id hop on the bike and make my way down to the mall around 635 for a 700am start time side note the ride down the mall when the roads are shut down was glorious hit every green light along the way and its totally downhill it was a serene way to begin the marathon dayraceso i cant say this rock and roll marathon was super well organized at least i couldnt find where anything was in the starting area and i couldnt be bothered to open up the map so i asked someone where the baggage drop off was and it was a bit of a walk away by the time i got to the bag dropoff line the national anthem was being butchered in the background and i knew i wouldnt make my corral corral 1 i didnt really care because the mall has some wide roads and ill have plenty of space to pass however finding parking for my bike was a bitch and i eventually found a tree who knows if its still thereso the marathon starts and im cruising along i decide for this marathon to trust my training and use my heart rate as a guide i choose to stay in the 120150 heart rate zone i know i can keep this up forever so i said fuck the pace and lets just do it livei felt great miles flew by i saw my partner and my best friend in my neighborhood and ran along roads i know like the back of my hand i retraced the steps i had taken hundreds of times before little vignettes popped up in my mind of all the times i had been here this is where i ran after a hard emotional day and remembered the feeling of dried moisture on my face thats where i gave up on a 8 mile run because my pf was acting up and felt the shame of quitting thats where my dog always likes to shit during our runs we hit the half marathon mark and moved into anacostia a historically black and low income neighborhood i dont really know why the race organizers thought it was a good idea to run through this neighborhood dont get me wrong im not worried about any safety or anything but my reservations could be summed up by one woman who came out of her home looked at us running and shouted i wish i could run too but i cant you and your privilege  it was a sobering reminder of how lucky i was to be able to take a full saturday to run and enjoy my body something so many people in this country cannot afford to do anyway back to the run i kept waiting for the moment when my legs would start hurting like they usually do but it never came 13 14 15 flew by and still i felt fresh hot damn those hills in anacostia were no joke but i had trained on hills and they were a cake walk for me i chased the peaks i figured if

 training

in theory right now i should be in the midst of training for a 100k race i have coming up beginning of may and should rack up a lot of vertical gain however when i read about the oakland marathon crossing the bay bridge as the first running event i was intrigued i switched my training a bit and added a bit more speed and interval training otherwise im just trying to run as often as i can and get some quality workouts scheduled my normal weeks are somewhere between 40 and 50 mpw but nothing specifically tailored or no particular training plan

coming into race week i started dreaming of going somewhere between 330 and 345 i did the math in my head and believed that i should be able to do it turns out that to get to 330 i would have to run at hm pace from my previous pr from a year earlier for double the distance

 prerace

waking up early drinking coffee enjoying a pbh spending some quality time in the bathroom to avoid hitting the lou during the race it was quiet got a ride to the starting line and waited

 race

 miles 1  13

for a first time marathoner like me making sure to not burn out too quickly was hard i really tried hard to slow myself down but i wanted to get around the 330 pace group and stay there but then the sun came out and my legs shifted up a gear it felt good cruising through oakland doing some weird loops downtown then moving up north to emeryville and finally hitting the trail to the bay bridge by the time we got on to the bay bridge i knew that i went out too fast i was running my hm pace from last year  while i was getting calories in every 5 miles they didnt taste as good anymore as they did in the beginning

 miles 1420

we were continuing on the bay bridge with a teeny tiny bit of elevation up the bridge and directly turning around at the end around mile 17 i started feeling stuff falling apart my legs didnt turn over that well anymore and my pace slipped first i was passed by the 330 then 335 pace group around mile 20 everything started to suck i hated that we had to run one street up and on the other side down because it felt like wasted energy why couldnt they just make a real loop all the friendly smiles that i got on the side didnt help me my pace dropped and my energy went down

 miles 21  26

around mile 21 my stomach started to rebel i really need a bathroom break finally at the next relay station i saw a bunch i cruised to the side wanting to get in and then i saw the line of people waiting not runners but spectators one person left the stall and i was looking at the next person in line for some understanding that as a runner i dont really want to wait 10 minutes in line but she ignored me and simply went in at this point in time i said screw it and continued

now was the time trail math started in my head my race screen was increasing my predicted total time and it started slowly creeping up from 340 to 341 to 342 and so on at the same time all my energy was gone my feet were hurting and running became hard i knew that i did not eat enough but all the sweet stuff was absolutely not appealing to me i dragged myself forward 344 345 the 345 pace group passed my laughing and happy i hated them i  did a couple of walkrun episodes to just relax a bit forward forward  348 349 i tried to convince myself that 1 remaining mile is not so bad and that running was easy one food in front of the other finally i could see the finish line 350 351

and so i made it 35252 i was so concentrated on dragging myself over the finish line that i didnt even see my family directly under the finish line arch

 postrace

all i wanted to do was sit down somewhere i took a couple of minutes break and took a deep breath in all fairness im really happy with the result i wanted to get sub four hours and i did everything else would have been icing on the top given the fact that i just started seriously running about 12 months ago im more than happy now my legs and butt is sore but its not as bad as i imagined the biggest surprise for me is that i have zero blisters i spent a lot of time before the race applying antichafe products and trimming everything due to bad experience at jackpot in february where i lost two toenails shortly after the race and had lots and lots of blisters

now i will relax today tomorrow and then start ramping up again to finally get my hill training in for the miwok 100k and when this is done enjoying the berlin marathon later this year

to summarize a marathon can be a humbling experience but its as well an opportunity to learn and understand now i have more data points to leverage for pacing and fueling strategies and how to be overall happier during the race

 training

i started running at the end of february i didnt do couch to 5k as im a pretty lean 22f and figured i could manage as long as i took it easy i basically started on 4 km and worked up in the couple weeks before the race i was settling into a four day a week routine with two 5kms a 3km although tbh i skipped this fairly frequently and then a long run on the weekend my 5k times were coming in around the 3230 mark and both of the 10k long runs i did were in the 107108 range so i was hoping for a little faster than that at sub105

 prerace

we got there basically right before the race started so it was just pushing our way through the massive crowd 10000 participants and then we were off no time to stretch

 race

i was running with my mom it was so much fun there were tons of people cheering us on which i wasnt expecting the first couple kilometers were rough but by the 3km mark i was feeling pretty good my mom and i were actually fairly wellmatched in terms of pace and staying with her kept me from pushing too hard at the beginning the route was really pretty and not too hilly i liked going past beacon hill park and by the water the little kids along the sides with signs and high fives were a great motivator there was a bit of a sad moment for my mom when we crossed the 5km mark because she had thought we were at 6km  but i was ecstatic halfway there we got stuck next to a woman running with a cowbell for about three kilometers which was starting to drive us a little insane we sprinted a bit to get past her but then she picked up some speed and caught up to us 

at about the 9km mark i took off on my mom and decided to push as hard as i could to the finish line at first it was cool to be flying by people but when i caught up to the crowd that was running at around that pace i was about ready to drop hahaha i somehow managed some sort of almostsprint thing when i saw the finish line i was disappointed when i saw the 10048 on the clock as i was hoping that id managed a sub 60 i didnt realize that the bib time starts when you actually cross the start line so it will be shorter so it was a nice surprise when i checked my results later

 postrace

i was not prepared for enormous stationary crush of people when i crossed the finish line there i am doubled over and panting hoping im not going to throw up and theres thousands of people pressed around me shuffling sloooowly towards the juice i found my mom we grabbed some snacks and decided to peace asap because the crowd was overwhelming we headed back to shower and then went out for a delicious brunch i had the best ham and cheese crepes ive ever had and that was it i was really excited with the whole experience and i am sure i will be doing another one soon hahaha

 training

i try to keep a base of about 30 milesweek i got pretty burned out after running my first marathon in october and tried to keep both my training and the race relaxed and fun i did some speed work and plenty of long runs in the 1014 mile range  i tried to listen to my body and take rest days when i needed them i planned to run the race to just enjoy the course and learn to enjoy racing again 

x200b

a few weeks before the race i got a snapchat memory of a 5 mile race from last year it was the first race i ran with my watch and i wasnt prepared for the gps interference my watch read a 12 minute mile so i pushed the pace and ended up running a 708 pace  much faster than what i thought i was capable of after that race i increased my mileage introduced speed work and really improved my endurance and pace i havent been able to replicate that pace at even a 5k distance i believe this is purely mental and i thought if i could prepare myself mentally id be able to at least beat my pr of 145 and run under an 8 minutemile i didnt tell anyone but it sort of became my goal 

x200b

 prerace

i live in the chicago area a little over an hour from milwaukee i paid an extra 10 to be able to pick up my bib on the day of the race but they recommend you get there an hour before the race i woke up at 4 was on the road by 430 picked up my mom and made our way north we got to milwaukee around 6 i picked up my bib in less than two minutes used a portapotty then stood around for a while the race was held at a large stadium said stadium was locked and runners were left out in the cold it was cloudy and 40 degrees not bad for running but not good for just standing around

x200b

finally got to my corral my plan was to run with a pace group and not even glance at my watch the entire race but the only pacers i could find anywhere were running a 935mile pace too slow i made my way forward a few corrals but there wasnt a pace group in sight i thought my chances of meeting my pr were shot 

x200b

 miles 1 to 7

like my previous race the tall buildings in downtown milwaukee interfered with the gps on my watch i wasnt expecting this in such a small city but it worked to my advantage what i thought was a 830mile ended up as a 739mile it felt easy and i decided to try to keep the pace it felt easy and my heart rate stayed in the aerobic zone until mile 7 i was surprised by a large hill at mile 35 it slowed me down and it took me a while to recover my pace but i excel at hills and ended up passing a lot of people which gave me more confidence 

x200b

x200b

 miles 7 to 13

my heart rate shot up and the race began to feel hard around mile 8 i was running an average pace of 752 i told myself i could slow down to an 800 pace at mile 10 at mile 95 i just lost it and just couldnt go on  i feel like it was mental but looking back at my data my hr was high i stopped for what i told myself was only going to be ten seconds to get my hr down it ended up being longer and my hr did not drop i use the race screen app and watched my average pace go over 8 i just couldnt recover mentally or hr from that i put my hr graphs above as my hr doesnt seem correlated to pace or elevation im not sure if my mental block led to a spike in hr or if the hr spike led to a mental block  i ended up walking a bit more and was almost in tears because i knew i lost it there was another hill around mile 10 or 105 it was gradual but tough mentally i walked because why not there was no point in pushing myself at this point 

x200b

x200b

 postrace

stocked up on snacks a man came up to me and told me good race i guess we kept passing each other but i was too upset to notice i told him it was my worst half in a while and he said it was his too it was nice to know i wasnt the only one i took my mom to brunch and drove home smelly and depressed 

x200b

 whats next

i already started reading 8020 by matt fitzgerald in an effort to get my heart rate under control a friend talked me into running the indy mini with her next month i plan to train hard the next few weeks and get ready to crush it in indy apparently its worth a high race fee 89 to pad my ego

x200b

 ive decided that i like an unfamiliar course courses close to home im always very keenly aware of where i am and how far away from the finish line i  am geographically ignorance is bills and i may venture out for more races 

x200b

advice for preparing myself mentally for the next race as well as any insight to my heart rate is welcome

x200b trainingi try to keep a base of about 30 milesweek i got pretty burned out after running my first marathon in october and tried to keep both my training and the race relaxed and fun i did some speed work and plenty of long runs in the 1014 mile range  i tried to listen to my body and take rest days when i needed them i planned to run the race to just enjoy the course and learn to enjoy racing again x200ba few weeks before the race i got a snapchat memory of a 5 mile race from last year it was the first race i ran with my watch and i wasnt prepared for the gps interference my watch read a 12 minute mile so i pushed the pace and ended up running a 708 pace  much faster than what i thought i was capable of after that race i increased my mileage introduced speed work and really improved my endurance and pace i havent been able to replicate that pace at even a 5k distance i believe this is purely mental and i thought if i could prepare myself mentally id be able to at least beat my pr of 145 and run under an 8 minutemile i didnt tell anyone but it sort of became my goal x200b preracei live in the chicago area a little over an hour from milwaukee i paid an extra 10 to be able to pick up my bib on the day of the race but they recommend you get there an hour before the race i woke up at 4 was on the road by 430 picked up my mom and made our way north we got to milwaukee around 6 i picked up my bib in less than two minutes used a portapotty then stood around for a while the race was held at a large stadium said stadium was locked and runners were left out in the cold it was cloudy and 40 degrees not bad for running but not good for just standing aroundx200bfinally got to my corral my plan was to run with a pace group and not even glance at my watch the entire race but the only pacers i could find anywhere were running a 935mile pace too slow i made my way forward a few corrals but there wasnt a pace group in sight i thought my chances of meeting my pr were shot x200b miles 1 to 7like my previous race the tall buildings in downtown milwaukee interfered with the gps on my watch i wasnt expecting this in such a small city but it worked to my advantage what i thought was a 830mile ended up as a 739mile it felt easy and i decided to try to keep the pace it felt easy and my heart rate stayed in the aerobic zone until mile 7 i was surprised by a large hill at mile 35 it slowed me down and it took me a while to recover my pace but i excel at hills and ended up passing a lot of people which gave me more confidence x200bx200b miles 7 to 13my heart rate shot up and the race began to feel hard around mile 8 i was running an average pace of 752 i told myself i could slow down to an 800 pace at mile 10 at mile 95 i just lost it and just couldnt go on  i feel like it was mental but looking back at my data my hr was high i stopped for what i told myself was only going to be ten seconds to get my hr down it ended up being longer and my hr did not drop i use the race screen app and watched my average pace go over 8 i just couldnt recover mentally or hr from that i put my hr graphs above as my hr doesnt seem correlated to pace or elevation im not sure if my mental block led to a spike in hr or if the hr spike led to a mental block  i ended up walking a bit more and was almost in tears because i knew i lost it there was another hill around mile 10 or 105 it was gradual but tough mentally i walked because why not there was no point in pushing myself at this point x200bx200b postracestocked up on snacks a man came up to me and told me good race i guess we kept passing each other but i was too upset to notice i told him it was my worst half in a while and he said it was his too it was nice to know i wasnt the only one i took my mom to brunch and drove home smelly and depressed x200b whats nexti already started reading 8020 by matt fitzgerald in an effort to get my heart rate under control a friend talked me into running the indy mini with her next month i plan to train hard the next few weeks and get ready to crush it in indy apparently its worth a high race fee 89 to pad my egox200b ive decided that i like an unfamiliar course courses close to home im always very keenly aware of where i am and how far away from the finish line i  am geographically ignorance is bills and i may venture out for more races x200badvice for preparing myself mentally for the next race as well as any insight to my heart rate is welcomex200bthis post was generated using the new

 training 
i started training with plenty of time doing 5ks during the week and a long run increasing a mile a week on the weekends managed three 10 mile runs leading up to the race after my last long run 11 miles i had some pain on the bottom of my right foot that i couldnt ignore doc diagnosed tendonitis and gave me a brace to prevent ankle rolling i had planned on some 6milers the week before the race but tossed that tendonitis did reduce significantly and i was confident running without the brace 

 prerace 
muster time for the race was 430 am with a start time of 530 i carpooled with a friend for a pickup time of 300 am i went to bed at 830 pm but a solid sleep was not meant to be between a beeping phone loud neighbors and my husband coming home at 1 am it was fitful rest at best but enough had a banana for breakfast my friend picked me up then another running buddy and we made it to the muster point easily the bus up the mountain let me catch a few zs the temps balmy in the vegas valley dropped significantly after a 4500 feet my friend lent me a turtleneck to stop my chattering teeth and the provided gloves were great in keeping my hands warm it was nice to see the sunrise from the very first light 

 race 
race start was 530 am right into the sunrise i hit the porta potties directly before the start line which meant i started about 10 minutes after gun time i was without my friends but i didnt have to fight through a crowd so that was good not so good – i forgot my headphones
 
miles 14 
i had planned to run at a 12minute pace for the first 5 miles but after listening to my buddies decided to go with where my feet took me with a sub 11 pace on the first mile i pulled back to aroundjust over 11 for the rest of the major decline the scenery was lovely and the volunteers were spirited and helpful i thought 230 finish time was in sight 

miles 48 
after mile 6 we were out of the scenic part of the mountain and running directly into the now fullyrisen sun this is where i was really grateful for the goodr sunglasses swag  second best swag ive received from a race my legs still felt good and the mood was enthusiastic at mile 8 i had a major potty break which was a relief even after 5 minutes of in a portapotty 230 finish was still possible from my watch so i was pretty excited 

miles 913 
i felt much better after my guts straightened themselves out but i lost the momentum of the steep declines of the mountain additionally the temps had heated up dramatically – a combination of dropping altitude and the standard vegas morning heat finally this section of the race is along a freeway and then into the suburbs its not nearly as inspiring scenery as the first third of the race but at least we werent running directly into the evil yellow orb anymore in fact theres a bit where you are facing the mountain you just ran down so you get a nice view 

  at the last rest stop volunteers gave out water and powerade but also otter pops and wet towels i was already doublefisting water and a pop so ducked down for the volunteer to put the towel on my head im sure theres a race photo of me with a sopping wet towel dribbling onto my face but i didnt care best rest stop of the race 

  my goal was 230 run time and my watch at mile 25 had me at 215 that last mile was full of grunts yelling at myself and clapping with plenty of spectator support and damn it all if it wasnt my fastest mile garmin time had me in at 228 as it autostopped during bathroom breaks so goal kinda achieved actual chip time was 235 still 10 minutes off my previous pr 
  
 postrace 
enjoyed pizza and some lagunitas beer at the postrace party then got dropped off at home for a fourhour nap i was surprised with the deep blue rub sample i didnt think it would do anything but the soles of my feet were killing me and the rub did decrease the pain

 training
i started running back in december after losing over 100lb in weight last year i was an obese 46 year old who was drinking too much and eating a lot of junk
to my absolute surprise i quickly fell in love with running graduated c25k ran a sub 30 min 5k race and built my distance up to 10k i entered this race to keep me accountable and give some focus to my training 

i am lucky enough to live on the beautiful island of mallorca and this race is held annually along the paseo maritimo in our gorgeous capital city 

i recently ran a 54 minute 10k and hoped to run this in 53 mins but the week before i encountered some knee pain i bought a patella strap which helped significantly but i made a deal with my partner that i would walk the second i felt any pain in the race more on this later

 prerace
start time for the 10k and half marathon was 11am i woke up at 7am had a meal replacement bar with a couple of cups of coffee got myself sorted out and went outside to wait for my mate who was running the half to pick me up as soon as i got outside i realised how unseasonably warm it was approx 22c at 9am and not a cloud in the sky

we parked up and walked around a kilometre to the start area where i did some light jogging to warm up the temperature was still climbing

 kilometer 15
there were a couple of thousand people starting so the first kilometre was spent weaving around people and trying to get into a rhythm luckily everyone soon spread out and as we passed the first kilometre mark by the stunning palma cathedral i was feeling great

i settled down around a 530 pace which felt fast but sustainable and enjoyed the atmosphere the organisers sensibly added extra water stations as it was around 26c by now and i made sure to hydrate myself my family we waiting at the 4k mark and seeing them gave me a real boost

 kilometers 5 to 10
at the 5k mark we made a sharp turn into the marina before heading back down the paseo in the opposite direction just before 6k i felt a twinge in my knee remembering my promise i immediately started to walk the pain went and i started running again this continued all the way to the finish i would run until my knee hurt and then walk again until the pain eased off i realised my goal of 53 mins was not going to happen but hoped to get in under an hour

when i hit the 9km mark the crowds were much bigger there was music and a great atmosphere which spurred me on to cross the line in 5943 chip time but weirdly my garmin watch had me at 5853 so not sure what happened there

 postrace
we were moved along the finish area and given bottles of powerade our medals a bag containing an energy bar fruit and water i then found the beer tent grabbed a delicious and well deserved pint and stood by the finish to cheer on the last of the 10k runners and the half marathoners

there were a lot of people caught out by the heat and the first aid stations were very busy but everything was well organised and people who needed help were attended to quickly and efficiently 

in conclusion it was a fantastic event held in stunning surroundings  and i would recommend it to anyone

 training

so i kind of stumbled into this by accident long story short fitness has been a big part of my life the last few years but as a now 23 year old guy a lot of that has been lifting oriented i love lifting but my cardiovascular health has been this thing that ive always sort of known is more important but ive been putting off id occasionally cycle but going back like 10 years running has been my achillies heel i think i may still be slightly traumatized by failing this almost abusive running test my middle school made us do every few months over and over again video of this herehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsny8wiyv8t404s  not my school i have tried c25k a few times and it just hasnt really happenedturns out training for 131 miles is a lot easier

x200b

anywaymy family has a history of heart issues and at the beginning of the year i was basically like this is ridiculous i should be able to run 3 miles without stopping at the same time i wanted to stay relatively well rounded during this process so i started the tactical barbellhttpsredditcomrtacticalbarbell base building program which over the first few weeks combines running increasingly longer times with cross training this was going really well and by week three or so i had run 30 minutes without stopping which i was really proud of then 40 then 50 then 60

x200b

it was at this point that i was likeuhmaybe theres something to this this was in late february and i decided i would train for a half in disney all the way in october no problem i jumped on the hal higdon novice 2 program and by mid march i ran 10 miles straight and sometime in late march i found this queens half and was like screw it im not waiting till october even if i wasnt as ready as i wanted to be i would hate waiting that long i ran 12 miles two weeks ago in 153 which felt great and i feel like i could have gone another couple miles so i knew this was going to end up being very close to a 2hr half for me which id be absolutely thrilled with

 prerace

i wanted to make sure i had a proper taper so the longest run i went on over the past two weeks following those 12 miles was 6 miles with two days off completely before the race if i could do it again i may have gone for a run closer to 10 miles last weekend but then again with my legs being tired during the race im not sure what exactly happened thoughts

x200b

the race started at 9am and ive learned that i run a lot better with a solid amount of food in my stomach so i was up at 6 eating a pbj and a couple eggs to go with some coffee then i had a banana once i got to the starting line about a half hour before the race and a cliff energy gel about 15 minutes before i made sure to stay hydrated too

 miles 1 to 3

i started off feeling good and pacing well at a 910 first mile going to 913 i was where i needed to be to hit 2 hours but i tried hard to not go unnecessarily fast at the start and i think i did an alright job of that although looking at all the splits im not so sure i’m a little surprised to see a 925 third mile because i was still feeling good by that point

 miles 3 to 6

it didn’t take very long for my legs to get tired which was suprising given the easy week they had but by mile 4 i was feeling it a bit i wasn’t winded but my legs were still i kept going and felt confident that i’d be able to push at the end to hit my target time since i was so close i had my second energy gel around mile 4

 miles 6 to 10

things began to get a little iffy here the leg fatigue that i was feeling earlier began to ramp up and as a whole everything was just getting more difficult i was thinking more than i would have liked to at this point but was happy to be past the halfway point which is always a mental boost i had my final energy gel around mile 8 setting me up for a strong finish

 miles 10 to 131

i hit a wall i’m not quite sure why but around mile 10 everything became so difficult i refused to walk so i kept running but i knew it wasn’t at the pace i needed to be at because of this it was also around the time i accepted that i was unlikely to hit 2 hours and tried to just enjoy the rest of the run as much as i could mile 12 was better and it felt good to be moving again but nothing felt as good as crossing that freakin finish line because i was really tired by the end i did it

 postrace

i had an apple stretched for a bit took the most amazing shower and then went off to a bar to watch the sixers game with a friend i am so sore still but i guess thats what i get

 whats next

idont know of course i need to run another half asap to get under 2 hours and want to do a shorter race every month or so but i do want to bring some strength training back into my life any suggestions for how to best structure running two or three days a week instead of four or five i will say though that im very much looking forward to a lifetime of running from here on out there is truly not a better way to explore the world around me

proper taper so the longest run i went on over the past two weeks following those 12 miles was 6 miles with two days off completely before the race if i could do it again i may have gone for a run closer to 10 miles last weekend but then again with my legs being tired during the race im not sure what exactly happened thoughtsx200bthe race started at 9am and ive learned that i run a lot better with a solid amount of food in my stomach so i was up at 6 eating a pbj and a couple eggs to go with some coffee then i had a banana once i got to the starting line about a half hour before the race and a cliff energy gel about 15 minutes before i made sure to stay hydrated too miles 1 to 3i started off feeling good and pacing well at a 910 first mile going to 913 i was where i needed to be to hit 2 hours but i tried hard to not go unnecessarily fast at the start and i think i did an alright job of that although looking at all the splits im not so sure i’m a little surprised to see a 925 third mile because i was still feeling good by that point miles 3 to 6it didn’t take very long for my legs to get tired which was suprising given the easy week they had but by mile 4 i was feeling it a bit i wasn’t winded but my legs were still i kept going and felt confident that i’d be able to push at the end to hit my target time since i was so close i had my second energy gel around mile 4 miles 6 to 10things began to get a little iffy here the leg fatigue that i was feeling earlier began to ramp up and as a whole everything was just getting more difficult i was thinking more than i would have liked to at this point but was happy to be past the halfway point which is always a mental boost i had my final energy gel around mile 8 setting me up for a strong finish miles 10 to 131i hit a wall i’m not quite sure why but around mile 10 everything became so difficult i refused to walk so i kept running but i knew it wasn’t at the pace i needed to be at because of this it was also around the time i accepted that i was unlikely to hit 2 hours and tried to just enjoy the rest of the run as much as i could mile 12 was better and it felt good to be moving again but nothing felt as good as crossing that freakin finish line because i was really tired by the end i did it postracei had an apple stretched for a bit took the most amazing shower and then went off to a bar to watch the sixers game with a friend i am so sore still but i guess thats what i get whats nextidont know of course i need to run another half asap to get under 2 hours and want to do a shorter race every month or so but i do want to bring some strength training back into my life any suggestions for how to best structure running two or three days a week instead of four or five i will say though that im very much looking forward to a lifetime of running from here on out there is truly not a better way to explore the world around methis post was generated using the new

 training
to give a little background i ran xc and track in high school and choose to coach instead of running in college after i graduated long story short its been almost 6 years since i last ran in high school i grew lazy and ballooned in weight from 170180lbs to about 240lbs i wasnt happy with my fitness levels how i felt physically and the soreness in my knees after playing sports or trying to go on runs with friends i decided in september of 2018 that i wanted to lose weight and run a half marathon with the idea that i had never ran further then 10 miles on purpose and this would be a new experience i decided that i wanted to make this an enjoyable race early on and i ran almost exclusively base work peaking at 60 kilometers in a week and a 12 mile run early on i decided to switch my training measurements to kilometers because i would be negative with myself when comparing myself to how fast i was in high school this was great for my attitude about training as every new run was a new pr where i had no idea what my splits meant until i was several months in things progressed well and quickly the weight melted off and i came into race day under 210lbs i initially thought that i would be able to get back under 200lbs by race day but i was happy with my progress despite this i had several awesome days throughout the michigan winter that led me to believe that not only would i crush 145 i may be able to run under 140 or even 138 this excitement was tampered when about 4 weeks before race day my right achilles started to bother me to the point where i felt forced to take several days off and wasnt sure id be able to run this race i managed to baby it along with a few 5k runs lots of ice and some corrective exercises i found online for achilles tendinitis i managed to come into race day not 100 confident in how fast i would be able to run the race but confident in knowing that i would at least be able to finish now that id been taking care of my achilles 

 prerace
luckily for me this race is right in my backyard packet pickup was within a mile of my apartment and the start line was only a few miles away i got up at about 5am made some chocolate chip pancakes with peanut butter and a banana then i was out the door to find parking and hang out around the start line i ran a single kilometer about 1520 minutes prior to the race just to get loose and then i was ready 

 race
the race began at 730 and it was pretty cool out only about 30 degrees but warm enough to have a longsleeve and basketball shorts do the trick i was delightfully surprised to find a 137 half marathon pacer that hadnt been advertised leading up to the race i ran the first 2k through downtown with the pacer and was feeling pretty good i hit about 4k with them and decided to take advantage of the serious downhill that occurred heading out of town at this point in the course this was my first and major mistake i had intended to come through 5k in 24 minutes and 10k in 48 minutes with the thought i would try and follow those up with 2330 5ks and run under 140 i blew through the 5k mark in 2229 and continued cruising at this pace hitting the 13 of the way mark in 133xx pace and moving on to the 10k mark in about 4430 it was at this point that i knew i messed up really bad after the 10k mark the race continues into gallup park which happens to be a park that i just hate running through for some reason adding a little salt to the soon to be wound when my pace blew up and blow up did it spectacularly i split 2335 for the 15k mark and tried to remind myself that i only had 6k left and i had built enough of a buffer to hit sub 138 or close to it if i could continue with 5 minute kilometers but i just didnt have the mental toughness at that point to stop myself from walking at least twice over the next 5k it was during these walk breaks that i realized the 137 pacers were behind pace by a fair amount but this still didnt stop them from blowing by me in the last quarter of the race the 4th 5k brought me out of gallup park around the university hospital and into the arboretum which is a fairly popular park in ann arbor with beautiful trails and gardens in the summer but notoriously hilly on the way in and out of i passed another runner who looked like he felt about as bad as i did and suggested we work together to finish the race under 140 but he never came with me when i tried to increase my effort to make sure we made it leaving me dying alone as i ran up the incredibly steep hills out of the arboretum once out of the arboretum i hopped on the struggle bus and ran incredibly slow finishing the 4th 5k split in 2651 around the 3k to go mark i realized that i would need to haul in order to crack 140 but i quickly realized my legs werent about to let me do that with 15k to go but i managed to drag myself through this and to the last kilometer as i rounded the corner the clock was showing 140xx i didnt want to finish and have to live with a 1410x pr so i hauled as best as my legs could and managed to finish in 14044 completing my first ever half marathon

 postrace
my legs felt like garbage and i realized that i had trained to finish a half but not actually race one i milled around and spoke to some people my dad knew before coming home and filling the tub with ice for a couple 20 minute ice baths all in all this was a very fun and challenging first half i learned a lot about pacing and realized that i need to run more mileage before i try and run one again this fall but im confident and excited that ill be able to knock out a serious pr come then

running in college after i graduated long story short its been almost 6 years since i last ran in high school i grew lazy and ballooned in weight from 170180lbs to about 240lbs i wasnt happy with my fitness levels how i felt physically and the soreness in my knees after playing sports or trying to go on runs with friends i decided in september of 2018 that i wanted to lose weight and run a half marathon with the idea that i had never ran further then 10 miles on purpose and this would be a new experience i decided that i wanted to make this an enjoyable race early on and i ran almost exclusively base work peaking at 60 kilometers in a week and a 12 mile run early on i decided to switch my training measurements to kilometers because i would be negative with myself when comparing myself to how fast i was in high school this was great for my attitude about training as every new run was a new pr where i had no idea what my splits meant until i was several months in things progressed well and quickly the weight melted off and i came into race day under 210lbs i initially thought that i would be able to get back under 200lbs by race day but i was happy with my progress despite this i had several awesome days throughout the michigan winter that led me to believe that not only would i crush 145 i may be able to run under 140 or even 138 this excitement was tampered when about 4 weeks before race day my right achilles started to bother me to the point where i felt forced to take several days off and wasnt sure id be able to run this race i managed to baby it along with a few 5k runs lots of ice and some corrective exercises i found online for achilles tendinitis i managed to come into race day not 100 confident in how fast i would be able to run the race but confident in knowing that i would at least be able to finish now that id been taking care of my achilles  preraceluckily for me this race is right in my backyard packet pickup was within a mile of my apartment and the start line was only a few miles away i got up at about 5am made some chocolate chip pancakes with peanut butter and a banana then i was out the door to find parking and hang out around the start line i ran a single kilometer about 1520 minutes prior to the race just to get loose and then i was ready  racethe race began at 730 and it was pretty cool out only about 30 degrees but warm enough to have a longsleeve and basketball shorts do the trick i was delightfully surprised to find a 137 half marathon pacer that hadnt been advertised leading up to the race i ran the first 2k through downtown with the pacer and was feeling pretty good i hit about 4k with them and decided to take advantage of the serious downhill that occurred heading out of town at this point in the course this was my first and major mistake i had intended to come through 5k in 24 minutes and 10k in 48 minutes with the thought i would try and follow those up with 2330 5ks and run under 140 i blew through the 5k mark in 2229 and continued cruising at this pace hitting the 13 of the way mark in 133xx pace and moving on to the 10k mark in about 4430 it was at this point that i knew i messed up really bad after the 10k mark the race continues into gallup park which happens to be a park that i just hate running through for some reason adding a little salt to the soon to be wound when my pace blew up and blow up did it spectacularly i split 2335 for the 15k mark and tried to remind myself that i only had 6k left and i had built enough of a buffer to hit sub 138 or close to it if i could continue with 5 minute kilometers but i just didnt have the mental toughness at that point to stop myself from walking at least twice over the next 5k it was during these walk breaks that i realized the 137 pacers were behind pace by a fair amount but this still didnt stop them from blowing by me in the last quarter of the race the 4th 5k brought me out of gallup park around the university hospital and into the arboretum which is a fairly popular park in ann arbor with beautiful trails and gardens in the summer but notoriously hilly on the way in and out of i passed another runner who looked like he felt about as bad as i did and suggested we work together to finish the race under 140 but he never came with me when i tried to increase my effort to make sure we made it leaving me dying alone as i ran up the incredibly steep hills out of the arboretum once out of the arboretum i hopped on the struggle bus and ran incredibly slow finishing the 4th 5k split in 2651 around the 3k to go mark i realized that i would need to haul in order to crack 140 but i quickly realized my legs werent about to let me do that with 15k to go but i managed to drag myself through this and to the last kilometer as i rounded the corner the clock was showing 140xx i didnt want to finish and have to live with a 1410x pr so i hauled as best as my legs could and managed to finish in 14044

 race
my races and pacing is split per 5k and adjusting per chunk if i need to speed up or slow it down so i dont bonk out  i worked the first half of the race to a near perfect 2 hour half marathon with a goal of finishing sub 415 pending any melt downs in the final 5k i finished 30k in 3 hours but within 6k i was having issues with gels and water  slowed me down and the goal was now to finish in under 430 i finished in full warm costume in the near 80f heat

 postrace
lots of chaffing as i had to remove a shirt halfway though the race as it heated up quickly i also have a nasty ankle scar from the timing chip getting a bit tight from swelling



 next race

 training

no training pretty much going into this race this was my first ever marathon where previously the longest i had run was 23km on some solo and group runs and have been a runner for years but rarely running more than 1015km on my long runs the marathon was a bucket list item but i was never organized enough to train for it properly and somehow decided a month or so ago to sign up for the paris marathon since i was planning to be there anyways and just do it

x200b

i run almost every day between 35km usually going to the gym or as part of broader crosstraining programs i started crossfit about six months ago and that forced me to take my running volume down somewhat but i still do it because i love it

x200b

 prerace

met up with a friend the night before and since were in paris had a nice dinner with a bottle of red wine obviously not the best approach but then again not having properly trained i wasnt expecting much

x200b

i barely slept the night before the race with about 34 hours of shuteye in total i think this was part the alcohol and part my generally disorganized sleep schedule

x200b

i woke up around 6am and had a light breakfast of mostly carbs around 730am 90min before race start

x200b

also i had run a 5k race exactly a week before the paris race and managed to injuresprain my left calf and that hadnt fully healed that was another reason for not running in the week before the marathon

x200b

 race

60000 people apparently registered for the race and i thought it was quite well organized i registered for the 345 pace group since i thought i could at least achieve that time but during the first half of the race i found myself pulling ahead of the pacer

x200b

the race started at around 915 am for our group and it was a beautiful day with temperatures perfect for running at around 5ºc and clear skies

x200b

people were stopping and peeing on the side of the road in some places but i managed to get through the whole race without having to do even though i did drink water a few times at the stands

x200b

the first 25km were surprisingly easy but this was just beyond my pr distance of around 23km so i was now in uncharted territory i also started taking advantage of the watersnack stands and eating bananas sugar cubes they do this in paris biscuits etc not because i felt i needed it but as insurance based on the stories id heard in the past thankfully i had no issues with bonking etc

x200b

my disaster was just past 25km when i started feeling pain in my left knee i was instantly depressed thinking id have to end my run but then decided to just slow down a bit and try to modify my gait to minimize the paindamage i have a number of theories as to why this happened including 1 lack of training for this distance 2 my left calf injury migrating upwards 3 new shoes ive had for just a week so not enough breaking in for a long race

x200b

since i was running at a 511 pace up to this point it was looking like i could have finished under 340 for my inaugural marathon but i had to stop a couple of times to stretch my muscles and ease the pain and so that cost me an extra 15 minutes

x200b

most importantly i was able to finish the race and my excitement more than made up for any problemsinjuriespain

x200b

 postrace

as soon as i stopped running at the finish line i started feeling sore in every part of my body from the waist downwards i am good at handling soreness being a crossfitter etc and have felt it in many parts of my body previously but having it everywhere at once was quite the shocker i grabbed a cab to the hotel showered and collapsed onto my bed for a couple of hours my left knee was sore for the next couple of days and i had a slight limp thats gone away now for the most part

x200b

 whats next

even though i really wanted to scratch the marathon itch and finally did i never had the time and focus to train for it and with this milestone achieved i plan to focus on other activities while keeping a base of running for both pleasure and performance ive been turned on to races though and think i may sign up to some 10ks or even half marathons but the marathon is probably something i may never do again unless i have a really good reason for it

x200b

one important revelation 42km4 hours of nonstop running is no joke and is an entirely different experience even for an experienced runner

x200b

also if youre ever going to do such a race make sure to do it somewhere stunning like paris the setting was stunning running amongst some of the world famous historic landmarks including the notre dame the day before the tragic fire

to scratch the marathon itch and finally did i never had the time and focus to train for it and with this milestone achieved i plan to focus on other activities while keeping a base of running for both pleasure and performance ive been turned on to races though and think i may sign up to some 10ks or even half marathons but the marathon is probably something i may never do again unless i have a really good reason for itx200bone important revelation 42km4 hours of nonstop running is no joke and is an entirely different experience even for an experienced runnerx200balso if youre ever going to do such a race make sure to do it somewhere stunning like paris the setting was stunning running amongst some of the world famous historic landmarks including the notre dame the day before the tragic

 training
i registered for the race my first half in over 5 years on a whim after having a really good running streak around new years i had started intermittent fasting and realized how much better my body felt while running completely fasted  i never really was timing myself super seriously but all of a sudden i was running in the 9ish minmile range instead of my usual 10 i figured if i trained a bit id probably be able to finish the race in under 2 hours so i set that as my goal

well then life happened and i started feeling more tired and just generally enjoying my runs a bit less it varied weektoweek with some being harder than others i think because i was still trying to lift heavy in the gym and just overloading my legs with everything i also wasnt following any official training plan basically just running 46 miles a few times a week before work and sprinkling in some long runs on the weekends but never going further than 10 miles my speed never really increased was averaging 93045 min miles so as time went by that initial goal of sub2 hours started seeming less and less likely i ended up setting a new goal of just finishing without taking any walking breaks since i walked a lot during my last and only other half this would still be a big achievement 

 prerace
i didnt do anything too crazy the day or night before had a friends birthday party that night which i left pretty early but not before eating my bodyweight in pizza d 

morning of was wake up at 6 coffee  getting ready and then leave the house at 715 i had stayed at my boyfriends house which is about a mile from the art museum where the starting and finish line was so by the time i walked over it was just about time to start definitely feeling some adrenaline at this point 

 miles 1 to 5
started out feeling strong wasnt checking my pace would later be shocked at how fast i was actually going from the very beginning but just trying to keep it comfortable so i didnt burn out too quickly after about a mile i noticed the official 2hr pacer  i had read about pacers a bit in my lurkings on this sub but never seen them in real life since i havent done a ton of races so nice to have though i didnt have a hard time keeping up with and passing him and was getting really excited that my sub2 hour goal might not be such a stretch after all at around mile 2 still feeling like i was at a comfy pace i saw the 155 pacer and pretty much stalked him like prey for the next few miles 

 miles 5 to 10
i had been refusing to take my eyes off the 155 pacer but around mile 6 i ended up passing him out i didnt think id end up that far ahead so still just aimed for staying at a steady pace since there was still over half the race to go 

mile 7 was the big hill i had been warned about i live in a really hilly part of the city and had been incorporating them in my training quite a bit  would start and end each of my runs by going up the steep halfmile hill near my apartment because i guess i love to torture myself despite all that preparation i wouldnt say this hill was easy however it didnt slow me down too too much 

around mile 8 i turned around and couldnt see the 155 pacer at all anymore and i started formulating a new planid take the gu i packed around mile 10 and use that as rocket fuel to blast off to finish maybe possibly in 150 it seemed crazy compared to my anticipated time going into the race but i was still feeling pretty good so why not try

 miles 10 to 13
i was a bit nervous to see how this all would go since i had never run over 10 miles straight in my life but my mile 8 plan went off without a hitch at mile 11 i started picking up the pace and at mile 12 i really started booking it after passing the mile 13 marker i pushed myself as hard as possible and checked my watch as i crossed the finish line14824 no  freakin way it started raining almost immediately after that which was good because i may have started crying just a little bit  

 postrace
after i caught my breath i chugged some water and did a little stretching probably could have done more in terms of recovery but i was too busy being ecstatic texting my family and telling my boyfriend every detail of the race i could not stop looking at my splits in disbelief ive never ran that fast in my life i kept thinking maybe my fitbit glitched but the official love run website confirmed my final time so i guess it has to be real woo still on cloud 9 a few days later and not sure how i pulled that off especially considering i felt so good for the whole race 

 whats next
broad street run on may 5 ive done it every year for the past 5 years and have always just ran it super casually but now i think im going to really try for a better time now that i know what im really capable of its 10 miles so im going to shoot for 120 maybe even 115 although that seems like a stretch but we shall see

so overall this was really just an amazing experience its crazy i was totally dreading this race in the days leading up to it but it ended up being the most fun ive had in so long special thanks to daft punk justice queen run the jewels and all the other artists on my race day playlist  100 gotta have those pump up jams for power and speed 

and thanks to you all for reading any tips or advice on how to keep improving because im still not convinced this wasnt just a fluke or where to go from here are much appreciated

background

i started running more regularly since may 2018 at first because i needed to lose weight and still do and it helped me burn some extra calories lately because i find it relaxing i started by running 2km three times a week directly to 5km and got there until march when i felt i could run more than that and ended up doing a 10km for the first time since then ive been running three times a week out of which one would be a 10km run and the others between 5 and 6 km after turning 18 recently and being able to participate to races i started considering trying to set a personal record at this race that was coming up my best time up until then was 10200 for a 10 km run and i was set on finishing the same distance in less than an hour 

x200b

training 

being my first ever event of this kind i wasnt really sure how i was supposed to train for it i knew i was capable of doing it without any trouble but i wanted to score a better time so i read a little about pacing and starting slower so i had an idea about how i was going to approach this thing i still have to learn about proper training plans but for now it worked 

x200b

prerace 

the day before the race i followed all the advice about not eating too muchtoo late or too spicy planned my meals for the next day worried about going to the toilet during the race so on and so forth by the time i needed to go to bed i was so hyped i only got 4 hours of sleep 

the next morning i headed to the race site left all my things in the designated area and then ran a lap around a nearby park to warm up the atmosphere was amazing music blasting some kind of show on a stage somewhere and tons of people looking ready to compete so i got an adrenaline rush that made up for the lack of sleep

x200b

race

 we were separated into four blocks from a to d based on the expected finish time with a being the closest to the start and d the farthest away i estimated a finish time of 11500 i dont know what was going through my head when i registered but whatever so i was in d the worst part of being that far behind is trying to overtake everyone ahead of you in order to escape the huge crowd so the first 2 minutes were really slow after that i reached a pace i thought was slower that what im used to and tried to stable my breathing so i could get in the right mindset turns out i was running much faster than how i usually run in the park probably due to the adrenaline and decided to keep doing that and see how it goes after the first kilometer the crowd dissipated and i was left with a few groups who seemed to know what they were doing so i paced myself according to them at about 25 kilometers i noticed i had left them behind and i was going pretty fast and there were only a few people around me the first refreshment point was at 5km but up until then i have been maintaining a fast enough pace so i decided not to slow down and continued i havent noticed any pacers along the way but i wasnt really paying attention either so i tried overtaking people when i got to close to them and slowing down if my breathing quickened when i reached 8km i was going a little to fast and i was out of breath for a few minutes but i slowed down because i wanted to sprint while crossing the finish line during last kilometer i gave all i had left in me and started the sprint with 500m left crossing the line and making for the worst photo ever taken of me 

x200b

postrace 

after getting my medal and taking some photos with the family i went to drink some water and snack on some fruits and after starting to breathe normally again i was on cloud 9 i felt like i could run this thing all over again right in that moment and still be able to walk home just fine once i sat in the car though i didnt want to stand ever again for an hour or so my morale touched the roof however after taking a shower and sleeping a little i woke up with a deep sense of dread which disappeared only after finding out i could register for another race next month 

x200b

whats next 

definitely going to do this again next month but i have to decide wether to try my hand at a half marathon or stick to 10km until the registration closes i will try to run up to 16 km and if i can handle it id like to try running the half after all there is no shame in walking

 standing behind my goal time at the expo a couple of days priorhttpsiimgurcomvtevzwdjpg


 background
this was my first marathon and first race event of any type given how notoriously difficult it is to get into by lotto less than 10 i applied on a whim and when i got my lotto result in late september i began training in earnest i live in tokyo so i saw it as a rite of passage as a firsttime runner

 training
this was perhaps my greatest folly

what i did a modified runners world marathon training plan for first timers with gradual progression peaking with a 32k long run three weeks out 

what i should have done a plan for insomniacs who can only get two hours sleep the night before due to nerves for 7c weather with continuous rain


 prerace
i dont sleep well before big events dating back to the first day of school i notched two hours the night before
the weather was extremely poor continuous rain and i think about 7c as we stood in the starting blocks for an hour or more by the end everyone was shivering some people had no rain gear depending on what weather forecast they had watched before taking the train after the gun it took me 18 minutes of slow walk to get to the start line and begin my block was quite far back because i had selected a time of 500600 when i applied for the race

 race

1k10k

on the first corner i put my left foot into a puddle that completely submerged it suddenly one foot was twice as heavy yay the first 10k was an exercise in frustration i assumed that since everyone was running in the same direction that running around people wouldnt be that difficult but there were just so many people and i exerted a lot of energy dodging people so i could get back to my usual pace  

10k20k

that two hours of sleep begun to catch up with me big time i had done three halfmarathon training runs which included hills and was maintaining 540km pace  but i was struggling to maintain anything near 600km which i knew i needed early on to get close to my goal breathing and hr were fine but the legs were not there

20k  30k

my wife was waiting for me at the halfway point and i said to her im slowing down but im gonna finish i downed my third gu at that point and plodded along at what felt like quite a slow pace

30k  finish

when i met my wife again at the 30k point all i could tell her was that i was somehow going to finish the race but at that point my goal was out the window as far as i could tell a couple of factors changed that firstly i had always planned to start my playlist from the 32k point to bring me home the last 10k and it gave me a definite burst of energy at the 33k point i realized that i had approximately an hour left before 430 and it seemed doable but there was funky math as i had started my watch a few minutes early then with 4km to go i got a message from a friend who was tracking me through an app linked to the actual chip times and he said i was 45 seconds off my oprah pace whats 25 minutes of pain so i booked it from there every step of the last km i was grimaced in pain but i got to the end with about a minute to spare

 postrace
this was the nicest part of the race if you ask me a volunteer drapes a finisher towel over your shoulders another puts a medal on you next you receive a fleece jacket then an opaque rain poncho and finally a goodie bag with sandwich and sports drink and i had run a marathon which is cool

 training
forthcoming wall of text is partly for me and partly for those that are chasing that unicorn and havent caught it or just starting out i have read quite possibly every post of every forum that you can imagine as my wife would say havent you read the entire internet yet i am writing this report to commemorate my journey to achieving a specific goal i set as well as give some hopeknowledge to anyone else attempting the same thing i have never bqd before never won a race and certainly dont consider myself anything like fast as someone starting out i was sick of reading other peoples training where they were running half the miles i was and still ending up qualifying what i learned however is that this journey isnt about them i have to do what i have to do to get the results i want mr or mrs lean machine can go right on averaging 40 or less miles a week for a year and go sub 3 that just isnt what i am capable of my training motto has been i may not be faster than you but i can certainly work harder and longer and suffer more improving at running really is pretty simple run a lot then run some more sometimes fast but mostly easy be patient keep working and you can reach your goal too i am not special talented gifted or anything of the sort

so i have been a lurker on reddit since i started running about 3 years ago i learned so much from all of you as i started this journey i listened to most of the consensus advice and slowly started improving i was never very athletic though i played some club sports in high school poorly when i started running a few years ago it was simply an aide to weight loss i woke up one morning at 40 years old a smoker almost 50 pounds overweight and not happy at all with who i was where i was and where i saw myself going i decided enough was enough and put on my trainers i fell in love with running and especially reading everyones race reports and times my first race i was literally dead last in my age group decided to give up smoking and switch to vaping still do it dont tell me it is bad for me i know however i ran through a couple of injuries and managed to go couch to marathon in about 5 months i dont recommend that as a general strategy fyi my first was a 426xx and miserable as i left the race to walk hobble like a penguin back to the hotel of course i thought i would never do that again by the time i got to the room i knew i would be back that decision changed my life for the better and i wouldnt change any single step since then running has taught me that hard work beats talent when talent doesnt work hard 

at that point i had lost 20 pounds but still wasnt done almost 50 lbs down since i started the next year i decided based on some others goals i had read to run the year and try to hit 2016 miles in 2016 i managed 2064 that next marathon was the 2017 houston heat wave death march literally my wifes co workers husband died at the finish line and i underperformed in the heat for a 348xx along the way i raced several hms trail runs etc decided to up my game just a bit and attempt an evern loftier goal of 2017 miles for 2017 and ended up with 2300 at this point i was running 5060 miles most weeks with mostly easy miles one day of speed and adding faster and faster portions to my long runs i have never followed a plan per se just listened to my body and gradually increase speed and mileage i have rarely been injured longer than just backing off a day or three and i also lift 23 days a week in the 2017 houston marathon i managed another pr at 32248 this was the most awesomely amazing disappointment ever my half pr based on the pace calculators put me near 315 and i felt like i wasted an opportunity to qualify though i had a great race and felt spent at the end 

for sure 2018 was going to be my breakout year right nah not so much i attempted tunnel light as my goal race after running 6075 mile weeks allllll through the miserable hudit hot houston summer tweaked one hamstring on the downhills at mile 10 tweaked the other somewhere near the halfway point and limpwalked the last 6 miles however i was able to come in first and second in my age group in some shorter races and finish the year with 2700 miles overall one thing to note i have 5 kids and run a small company i dont make excuses for training and i dont make excuses for not training i wake up at 330 most mornings get my run in and am back and helping out with the kids as they wake up when i need to i push my twin 4 year olds up to 16 miles in a double stroller  my wife has been incredibly supportive but running has taken nothing from my life it has only added to it 

after the disappointment in seattle i quickly built back up to 5060 and decided to make another go of it my wife wanted to run her first marathon so houston was out for me this time i settled on the woodlands since it is very close to my home and i do a fair amount of training runs there i used her marathon as a long training run she required me to pace her and she killed it beating my first marathon by 6 minutes at my current recovery pace and make it a superish week ended up with a peak of 85 miles that week and held 7075 for the 12 week total i ran the obligatory half marathon race in december just prior and had a massive pr for a 12905 on a pretty flat and cool course calculators put me in the 308xx range that honestly scared the shit out of me once i hit a 20 miler at an average of 708 which i had never come within 30 secmile of i thought i might just be in decent enough shape to do some real damage in the woodlands i also had two months of decent elevation gainloss to prep for some of the hills i would be dealing with


 prerace
standard carb load starting 3 days out 1 mile slow jog an hour before the race with one stride 


 race
so this isnt a huge race only about 1000 full marathon runners if you like big crowds screaming fans big names etc keep right on looking this race is also not exactly flat per se with a little over 500 ft elevation gain total houston is around 100 it can be a pr course if you train for it though the most crowd support i saw was mostly bored dads at intersections with a kid in a stroller staring at us freaks totally high fived every kid still

i may be a dork but i ran the last 6 miles of the marathon course no less than 10 times in the months leading up to the race each time a little faster than the last my plan was to sit with the 315 pacer and speed up if i could around mile 15 where the course starts its rolling downhill back to the finish line the pacer barely made the corral before we were off the first few miles felt harder than they should for sure i had about 23 weeks with a new watch that actually had a hr monitor on it a pretty fast friend of mine told me that he tries to keep his hr near 156 until mile 20 then anything over 160 for the last 10k we are the same age and run the same number of miles so i thought i would give that a try after mile 1 where my heart rate barely hit 140 a few times i decided to just run by effort with the occasional glances at my watch side note when i ran through a water stop some ahole in a triathlon suit literally pushed me from behind i asked him why and he said dont slow down jerk i called him an asshole and mean mugged him for the next mile or so certain that my stares would cause him physical or at least mental harm from there i only wanted to beat that smugness right off his super expensive sunglass wearing face and embarrass him with losing to a still somewhat fatty i was just a wee bit terrified of the change in strategy at mile 1 but decided to just roll with it and see what happens to stay in front of him i never saw him again in that race i was risking blowing up a little i thought but as i age into the next ag for boston in september and would just need to take 2 minutes off my pr instead of over 10 in houston and i figured what the hell right

i can honestly say that i gave it about as even effort as i could slowing down on the uphills then leaning into the downhills each mile ticked off with no sign of feeling too much worse when i hit the half under 135 my first thought was thats awesome followed by the doom of knowing i had a shot at sub 310 if i kept it up so i kept an even effort through 18 then gradually dropped my pace while simultaneously increasing the pain every mile after that was a mental game of wanting to walk and knowing that if i even let up a little i would be disappointed in myself again right at mile 21 i thought for sure i would walk then i had a brief thought that i grabbed and held onto what if i dont fail this time each successive mile from there was ran with that lone thought pounding through my brain at one point i was calculating how much i could slow down and still be under 310 i dont advise trying to do math at that point in a marathon by the way i tried for a few seconds realized i couldnt figure it out and just ran harder instead somehow my legs held together and i negative split not only the marathon but the last 4 miles of it as well mile 26 was my fastest of the marathon and the last 02 was the fastest i had ran in a several months no idea how that even happened when i saw the clock at the finish at 308xx it was all i could do to not start crying before i finished crossed the line just after it hit 309 had some manly tears to myself then looked for the wife finally after all the literally thousands of miles i had ran thinking about qualifying for the most prestigious race on earth i had made it i may not get to go to the dance with only a 47 second buffer but i couldnt be happier with my performance


 postrace
yeah i love racing but hate hanging around afterwards even if i place in my ag grabbed the medalshirt hobbled to the car and headed home for a nap

thanks for tolerating my ramblings thanks for teaching me about the joy of running thanks for putting yourself out there in your race reports for all to see whether you succeed or fail for a confirmed lurker like me it helps not feeling alone in this struggle if only one person reads this and finds some use of it even just the motivation to run a little more each week and reach their goals then it serves its purpose keep on running you beautiful weirdos

loss i woke up one morning at 40 years old a smoker almost 50 pounds overweight and not happy at all with who i was where i was and where i saw myself going i decided enough was enough and put on my trainers i fell in love with running and especially reading everyones race reports and times my first race i was literally dead last in my age group decided to give up smoking and switch to vaping still do it dont tell me it is bad for me i know however i ran through a couple of injuries and managed to go couch to marathon in about 5 months i dont recommend that as a general strategy fyi my first was a 426xx and miserable as i left the race to walk hobble like a penguin back to the hotel of course i thought i would never do that again by the time i got to the room i knew i would be back

marathon was the 2017 houston heat wave death march literally my wifes co workers husband died at the finish line and i underperformed in the heat for a 348xx along the way i raced several hms trail runs etc decided to up my game just a bit and attempt an evern loftier goal of 2017 miles for 2017 and ended up with 2300 at this point i was running 5060 miles most weeks with mostly easy miles one day of speed and adding faster and faster portions to my long runs i have never followed a plan per se just listened to my body and gradually increase speed and mileage i have rarely been injured longer than just backing off a day or three and i also lift 23 days a week in the 2017 houston marathon i managed another pr at 32248 this was the most awesomely amazing disappointment ever my half pr

obligatory half marathon race in december just prior and had a massive pr for a 12905 on a pretty flat and cool course calculators put me in the 308xx range that honestly scared the shit out of me

last my plan was to sit with the 315 pacer and speed up if i could around mile 15 where the course starts its rolling downhill back to the finish line the pacer barely made the corral before we were off the first few miles felt harder than they should for sure i had about 23 weeks with a new watch that actually had a hr monitor on it a pretty fast friend of mine told me that he tries to keep his hr near 156 until mile 20 then anything over 160 for the last 10k we are the same age and run the same number of miles so i thought i would give that a try after mile 1 where my heart rate barely hit 140 a few times i decided to just run by effort with the occasional glances at my watch side note when i ran through a water stop some ahole in a triathlon suit literally pushed me from behind i asked him why and he said dont slow down jerk i called him an asshole and mean mugged him for the next mile or so certain that my stares would cause him physical or at least mental harm from there i only wanted to beat that smugness right off his super expensive sunglass wearing face and embarrass him with losing to a still somewhat fatty i was just a wee bit terrified of the change in strategy at mile 1 but decided to just roll with it and see what happens to stay in front of him i never saw him again in that race i was risking blowing up a little i thought but as i age into the next ag for

doom of knowing i had a shot at sub 310 if i kept it up so i kept an even effort through 18 then gradually dropped my pace while simultaneously increasing the pain every mile after that was a mental game of wanting to walk and knowing that if i even let up a little i would be disappointed in myself again right at mile 21 i thought for sure i would walk then i had a brief thought that i grabbed and held onto what if i dont fail this time each successive mile from there was ran with that lone thought pounding through my brain at one point i was calculating how much i could slow down and still be under 310 i dont advise trying to do math at that point in a marathon by the way i tried for a few seconds realized i couldnt figure it out and just ran harder instead somehow my legs held together and i negative split not only the marathon but the last 4 miles of it as well mile 26 was my fastest of the marathon and the last 02 was the fastest i had ran in a several months no idea how that even happened when i saw the clock at the finish at 308xx it was all i could do to not start crying before i finished crossed the line just after it hit 309 had some manly tears to myself then looked for

 c set new pr  yes 

 background

im 36 ive been running for 78 years but i have yet to run a sub 18 minute 5k i have ran some good half times with a pr of 12927 but ive never been able to set a good 5k time that i was proud of previous pr of 1806 so in january i decided i wanted to just do a 5k training plan and see what i was capable of there was a local 5k that i knew would be some good competition running so i decided i would train for it ive met some serious runners in my town and ive trained with them for years and was coached by one of them for  many of my half marathons and trail races it was through running with them where i learned how to do workouts such as track work fartleks progression runs tempo runs etc

x200b

 trainingi had a decent base built up running 2535 miles a week on 5 days for a few months i would usually throw in some 1 min pickups during the week and a 2530 min fartlek on the weekend i would usually have a longrun of 813 miles it all depended on what i felt like running or what my friends plans werei choose an intermediatehttpswwwnewbalancecomondemandwarestaticsitesnewbalanceus2librarydefaultdwf5c44831documentsrundisneynewbalance5ktrainingintermediatepdf and an advancedhttpswwwnewbalancecomondemandwarestaticsitesnewbalanceus2librarydefaultdw7d81c79adocumentsrundisneynewbalance5ktrainingadvancedpdf  plan posted by new balance both plans had many workouts that  was familiar with the advanced plan was only 6 weeks long and had me running 7 days a week and it was pretty aggressive ive never run that often so i didnt want to dive right into that i ultimately decided to to run the last 6 weeks of the intermediate plan to reintroduce my body to the fast track work 400s1000s and then when i finished that id switch to the 6 week long advanced plan

x200b

at the end of the intermediate i did a 1 mile solo time trial on the track and came in at 517  i wasnt impressed but it was a 3 second improvement from my 1 mile pr from a few years ago so at least it was a step in the right direction i started the advanced plan 6 weeks out from my goal race date april 8th it was also then when i shifted focus from a local race to a bigger race and chose the carslbad 5000 since it was known as a fast race and it was at sea level i live at 3000ft so i hoped that it would help my time a little i stayed consistent and made sure i did each workout i had to move a track workout a day back sometimes but i didnt skip anything  it was here where i started seeing big improvements i had a ladder workout twice during the plan 1600m 1200m 800m 400 with 400 jogging recoveries between the first time was hard but the second one done the week before the race went really well the first 1600m was completed in at 527 and i was like wow only 10 seconds off my pr and was able to hold that pace for the rest of the distances a week before the race i did another 1 mile time trial and came in at 504 it was then that i was like wow im actually going to post a decent time

x200b

i work different shifts at work some times morning and sometimes mid shifts so i knew it would be a challenge to get all my track workouts in because i cant use the local highschools track while classes are in session so id either have to run track workouts early morning or 34pm after i got off work or if there was an after school activity i was sol and had to do my workout on the road it was then that i used my gps watch to measure out the interval distances on the road or my local parks parking lot where i knew it was flat and 400m long  it gets cold and extremely windy during winter here in vegas so i put in quite a few of my easy runs some long runs and even one tempo on the treadmill i kept my easy runs in the 745800 range depending how i felt the treadmill feels hard for me so they were all done at  slower 810830 pace my 400s progressed from low 80 seconds at the beginning of my training to mid to low 70s towards the end 25 min tempo runs went from 610 to 600 pace and 1000s went from 325s down to 315s

 preracei live in las vegas and decided that i was going to drive to san diego a 5 hour drive the day before there are 7 races held throughout the day mens masters womens masters mens 39  under womens 39  under party race womens elite and mens elite my race started at 905 am so i didnt wake up until 530 am i showered ate my tried and true prerun breakfast which is 3 packets of oatmeal and a yerbe mate tea at 8 am i ate a honey stinger waffle because i was pretty hungry and drank another half of a can of yerbe mate i then proceeded to start my warmup routine 30 minutes before race time i warmed up with a 2 mile run and scoped out the start line and finish line only a few blocks apart i then proceeded to do my drills and plyometric routine high knees butt kickers strides etc the weather was perfect calm wind sunny skies and 65f

x200b

 race strategytwo of my friends who have done this race before told me to bank time because there is a slight incline between miles 2 and 3 and the last 400m600m is down hill so you can easily speed up then i usually never bank time and run cautiously but ive read articles that say that people tend to run faster times when they go out fast during the 5k because there isnt enough time to speed up or youre too tired to speed up as the race progresses so i decided that i would go out no faster than 520mile but 530 was my goal i thought about going out even faster but thought that was too overconfident and that i might blow up i was in the corral 5 minutes early when they announced a train delay the race crosses a rail road twice it is part of the race so everyone knows that it is a possibility they opened up the corral and let everyone get some strides in if they wanted to keep the blood flowing i got a couple strides when i was back in the corral none other than olympic medalist and 2014 boston marathon winner meb keflezighi who is a partial race owner came through the corral started giving out high fives i was lucky enough to get one

 racethe race started and i took off there was some serious competition the first 3 in my race came in under 1500 but i knew better than to go out with them i ran by feel and by looking at my watch i was at 530 which is exactly where i wanted to be so i just held pace and stuck with a pack of runners i stuck to the inside of the course  as did almost everybody  i was so focused that i didnt even feel my watch vibrate to let me know i hit the first mile eventually i saw that i was still holding pace and was feeling good just wondering when im gonna start hurting just before mile 15 we took the first of two 180 turns and i focused on getting back up to speed and keeping my legs moving quickly slightly after that 17 miles in we hit a slight incline it wasnt bad but it was enough to put the hurt on you i was at around mile 2 is when things started getting hard good thing we hit a gentle 1 to 15 decline it helped ease the pain then we hit the second 180 turn and we were running right back up that now incline i started to see my pace drop to 550ish i then fell back on my track work and was dead set focused on form and turn over to keep me going i thought to myself less than one mile to go this isnt a track workout and i dont have to do any more repeats after this so i need to leave it all out here on the road at about 27 miles in things leveled out and i saw the corner  i knew once i got to it and turned it was all downhill from there i wasnt looking at my watch at the time but i after looking at my strava i found out i was accelerating from mile 27 to the finish going from 557 at  mile 27 520 at 28 504 at 29 and 430 for the last 2 miles i ended up running a 1717 throughout the race i kept jumping from pack to pack as my running packs slowed down during local 5ks im usually in no mans land running by myself so it was great to have people to stick with

 postracemy watch said 1717 my splits were positive but not my much 531 533 534  i couldnt believe that i just did that a few months ago i thought i was getting old and would be lucky to just break 18 minutes and i went in and shattered my previous pr i was ecstatic i took a moment to catch my breath and walked through the finishers corral and grabbed my finishers metal and a gatorade i was too exited to eat anything i cooled down by running half a mile to my car to grab my phone and call my wife who was unable to go with me i then proceeded to hang out at the beach which is literally less than a block away from the race course for an hour or two and get something to eat i was able to then watch the womens and mens elite races which started at noon and 1225pm respectively that evening after i returned home my glutes were extremely sore as were my quads this was probably exacerbated by the fact that i didnt stretch after the race like i usually do after every run and because i basically sat on my hard drivers seat for 5 hours straight i tried rolling them but to no avail but luckily the next morning they were fine and i was able to meet up with some friends to an easy 10 mile run

x200b

after thoughts

i love having a rigid running plan that i can just blindly follow everyday  when it comes to running i thrive off of that structure and consistency almost every time i stay true to the training plan i pr even though i didnt always have access to the track i still made sure i put the effort in and completed to the workouts  even though i was running 7 days a week the mileage wasnt very high only peaking at 48 mpw i wasnt sure i could handle the advanced plan and i thought that i might get injured or burnt out it just goes to show that if you take a risk it can pay off in a big way

x200b

i cant recommend this race enough if you are looking to do fast 5k this is the place to go during the elite race  edward cheserek tied the world record for a road 5k with a time of 1329 so that has to say something about the course the atmosphere is great the competition will push you and the weather was fantastic plus you get to hang out at the beach between races there is a race for everyone in the family theres a kids 1 mile on saturday the full races on sunday as well as an all day 5k where you can run the first four 5k races on sunday back to back the price for the 5k is extremely reasonable for a race of this caliber at only 45 with no hidden fees there are multiple timing mats on the course so you can see how to progressed and even what place you were ranked at the time you passed over the mats  i went from 89 to 66 in the mens category

httpscarlsbad5000comhttpscarlsbad5000com goals goal  description  completed  a sub 1730  yes  b sub 1800  yes  c set new pr  yes  backgroundim 36 ive been running for 78 years but i have yet to run a sub 18 minute 5k i have ran some good half times with a pr of 12927 but ive never been able to set a good 5k time that i was proud of previous pr of 1806 so in january i decided i wanted to just do a 5k training plan and see what i was capable of there was a local 5k that i knew would be some good competition running so i decided i would train for it ive met some serious runners in my town and ive trained with them for years and was coached by one of them for  many of my half marathons and trail races it was through running with them where i learned how to do workouts such as track work fartleks progression runs tempo runs etcx200b trainingi had a decent base built up running 2535 miles a week on 5 days for a few months i would usually throw in some 1 min pickups during the week and a 2530 min fartlek on the weekend i would usually have a longrun of 813 miles it all depended on what i felt like running or what my friends plans werei choose an intermediatehttpswwwnewbalancecomondemandwarestaticsitesnewbalanceus2librarydefaultdwf5c44831documentsrundisneynewbalance5ktrainingintermediatepdf and an advancedhttpswwwnewbalancecomondemandwarestaticsitesnewbalanceus2librarydefaultdw7d81c79adocumentsrundisneynewbalance5ktrainingadvancedpdf  plan posted by new balance both plans had many workouts that  was familiar with the advanced plan was only 6 weeks long and had me running 7 days a week and it was pretty aggressive ive never run that often so i didnt want to dive right into that i ultimately decided to to run the last 6 weeks of the intermediate plan to reintroduce my body to the fast track work 400s1000s and then when i finished that id switch to the 6 week long advanced planx200bat the end of the intermediate i did a 1 mile solo time trial on the track and came in at 517  i wasnt impressed but it was a 3 second improvement from my 1 mile pr from a few years ago so at least it was a step in the right direction i started the advanced plan 6 weeks out from my goal race date april 8th it was also then when i shifted focus from a local race to a bigger race and chose the carslbad 5000 since it was known as a fast race and it was at sea level i live at 3000ft so i hoped that it would help my time a little i stayed consistent and made sure i did each workout i had to move a track workout a day back sometimes but i didnt skip anything  it was here where i started seeing big improvements i had a ladder workout twice during the plan 1600m 1200m 800m 400 with 400 jogging recoveries between the first time was hard but the second one done the week before the race went really well the first 1600m was completed in at 527 and i was like wow only 10 seconds off my pr and was able to hold that pace for the rest of the distances a week before the race i did another 1 mile time trial and came in at 504 it was then that i was like wow im actually going to post a decent timex200bi work different shifts at work some times morning and sometimes mid shifts so i knew it would be a challenge to get all my track workouts in because i cant use the local highschools track while classes are in session so id either have to run track workouts early morning or 34pm after i got off work or if there was an after school activity i was sol and had to do my workout on the road it was then that i used my gps watch to measure out the interval distances on the road or my local parks parking lot where i knew it was flat and 400m long  it gets cold and extremely windy during winter here in vegas so i put in quite a few of my easy runs some long runs and even one tempo on the treadmill i kept my easy runs in the 745800 range depending how i felt the treadmill feels hard for me so they were all done at  slower 810830 pace my 400s progressed from low 80 seconds at the beginning of my training to mid to low 70s towards the end 25 min tempo runs went from 610 to 600 pace and 1000s went from 325s down to 315s preracei live in las vegas and decided that i was going to drive to san diego a 5 hour drive the day before there are 7 races held throughout the day mens masters womens masters mens 39  under womens 39  under party race womens elite and mens elite my race started at 905 am so i didnt wake up until 530 am i showered ate my tried and true prerun breakfast which is 3 packets of oatmeal and a yerbe mate tea at 8 am i ate a honey stinger waffle because i was pretty hungry and drank another half of a can of yerbe mate i then proceeded to start my warmup routine 30 minutes before race time i warmed up with a 2 mile run and scoped out the start line and finish line only a few blocks apart i then proceeded to do my drills and plyometric routine high knees butt kickers strides etc the weather was perfect calm wind sunny skies and 65fx200b race strategytwo of my friends who have done this race before told me to bank time because there is a slight incline between miles 2 and 3 and the last 400m600m is down hill so you can easily speed up then i usually never bank time and run cautiously but ive read articles that say that people tend to run faster times when they go out fast during the 5k because there isnt enough time to speed up or youre too tired to speed up as the race progresses so i decided that i would go out no faster than 520mile but 530 was my goal i thought about going out even faster but thought that was too overconfident and that i might blow up i was in the corral 5 minutes early when they announced a train delay the race crosses a rail road twice it is part of the race so everyone knows that it is a possibility they opened up the corral and let everyone get some strides in if they wanted to keep the blood flowing i got a couple strides when i was back in the corral none other than olympic medalist and 2014 boston marathon winner meb keflezighi who is a partial race owner came through the corral started giving out high fives i was lucky enough to get one racethe race started and i took off there was some serious competition the first 3 in my race came in under 1500 but i knew better than to go out with them i ran by feel and by looking at my watch i was at 530 which is exactly where i wanted to be so i just held pace and stuck with a pack of runners i stuck to the inside of the course  as did almost everybody  i was so focused that i didnt even feel my watch vibrate to let me know i hit the first mile eventually i saw that i was still holding pace and was feeling good just wondering when im gonna start hurting just before mile 15 we took the first of two 180 turns and i focused on getting back up to speed and keeping my legs moving quickly slightly after that 17 miles in we hit a slight incline it wasnt bad but it was enough to put the hurt on you i was at around mile 2 is when things started getting hard good thing we hit a gentle 1 to 15 decline it helped ease the pain then we hit the second 180 turn and we were running right back up that now incline i started to see my pace drop to 550ish i then fell back on my track work and was dead set focused on form and turn over to keep me going i thought to myself less than one mile to go this isnt a track workout and i dont have to do any more repeats after this so i need to leave it all out here on the road at about 27 miles in things leveled out and i saw the corner  i knew once i got to it and turned it was all downhill from there i wasnt looking at my watch at the time but i after looking at my strava i found out i was accelerating from mile 27 to the finish going from 557 at  mile 27 520 at 28 504 at 29 and 430 for the last 2 miles i ended up running a 1717 throughout the race i kept jumping from pack to pack as my running packs slowed down during local 5ks im usually in no mans land running by myself so it was great to have people to stick with postracemy watch said 1717 my splits were positive but not my much 531 533 534  i couldnt believe that i just did that a few months ago i thought i was getting old and would be lucky to just break 18 minutes and i went in and shattered my previous pr i was ecstatic i took a moment to catch my breath and walked through the finishers corral and grabbed my finishers metal and a gatorade i was too exited to eat anything i cooled down by running half a mile to my car to grab my phone and call my wife who was unable to go with me i then proceeded to hang out at the beach which is literally less than a block away from the race course for an hour or two and get something to eat i was able to then watch the womens and mens elite races which started at noon and 1225pm respectively that evening after i returned home my glutes were extremely sore as were my quads this was probably exacerbated by the fact that i didnt stretch after the race like i usually do after every run and because i basically sat on my hard drivers seat for 5 hours straight i tried rolling them but to no avail but luckily the next morning they were fine and i was able to meet up with some friends to an easy 10 mile runx200bafter thoughtsi love having a rigid running plan that i can just blindly follow everyday  when it comes to running i thrive off of that structure and consistency almost every time i stay true to the training plan i pr even though i didnt always have access to the track i still made sure i put the effort in and completed to the workouts  even though i was running 7 days a week the mileage wasnt very high only peaking at 48 mpw i wasnt sure i could handle the advanced plan and i thought that i might get injured or burnt out it just goes to show that if you take a risk it can pay off in a big wayx200bi cant recommend this race enough if you are looking to do fast 5k this is the place to go during the elite race  edward cheserek tied the world record for a road 5k with a time of 1329 so that has to say something about the course the atmosphere is great the competition will push you and the weather was fantastic plus you get to hang out at the beach between races there is a race for everyone in the family theres a kids 1 mile on saturday the full races on sunday as well as an all day 5k where you can run the first four 5k races on sunday back to back the price for the 5k is extremely reasonable for a race of this caliber at only 45 with no hidden fees there are multiple timing mats on the course so you can see how to progressed and even what place you were ranked at the time you passed over the mats  i went from 89 to 66 in the mens

training

i started training in august 2018 and i was quite consistant during 3 months i was runnig 57 days a week and going over 150kmmonth that was crazy and i was feeling great sadly at the begining of november i felt a strange pain in my righ hiplower back area and decided to stop running for a while fearing i was actually injured a few days suddenly was over a week without running then two and before i even realized 2018 was ending and i hant run anymore it was at this time that i spoke with one of my friends about actually runing a race as a way o pushing my self and having a goal he said yes although i am sure he is regretting that decision now and i started runnin again in january 2019 still i did not train enough especially my pace since i love to run very slow and we wanted to do 6minkm during the race

x200b

prerace

prerace i was quite excited and nervous during a whole week i could not stop talking about the race and im sure everybody around me got tired of it the morning before the race i took a quick coffee  and met my friend to go together

x200b

race

okey i havent been in any other race before so this actully surprised me but no food during the race seriusly like nothing

x200b

 it was a very sunny day which is completly fine except if you are allergic to sunny days yay as i said very sunny day with little shadow and we had only water to drink no galatoradepowerade or whateverade you like and nothing to eat so dehydration was coming for me faster than i was runing

x200b

we were in the 2h 10min group with a pacer that was honestly fascinating not only was he running at time but trying to cheer us and help us if possible sadly at km 10 i was already feeling down and it only got worse over time we managed to stay in the group up to km 16 where a climb pushed us backwards after that i was honestly at my worst and my friend left me to keep going while i walked for a little the only thing that kept me going was how close i was and the fact that the fastest i got there the fastest i could stop suffering

x200b

last 2 km were fine people cheering helped me a lot and i was feeling fresh compared to km 16 so i managed to get my pace back to about 6minkm right before crossing finish lane i sprinted a little to pass another guy which was my personal small victory i hope he didnt mind is not like it really matters being 2700th or 2701st

x200b

postrace

postrace i enjoyed my personal 30 mins of reditching body allergic to sun yay and drink as much as i could once in home i took a shower and went straight to bed before lunch

x200b

personlly i did actully enjoy the run but i do honestly believe it could have been a little better organized still it was my first race so what do i know thanks to ruben the pacer for his work and to my friend for running with me and also thnks to my parents for getting early on a sunday morning just to see me go by

training and progression

im 17 years old a senior in high school and spring track just started during the winter season i run 7080 mi a week and in the warmer months 8090 before i get bombarded about how a 17 year old does not need to run that high mileage in training i do it because i want to run ultramarathons in the near future in july i will be running my first 50 miler in colorado springs i was inspired to take this path after having the privilege of running with dean karnazes and krissy moehl in colorado and learning more about the sport through various book on the sport thanks dean karnazes anyway before i get into more ultra training i signed up for a few half marathons because it is currently my favorite distance to run two months ago i ran the nyrr fred lebow half marathon in central park with a time of 12753 slower than what i had run in the past due to the weather the following month i ran the nycruns half marathon in central park and ran 12133 beating my previous pr by a bit over 2min i had run the philly marathon at 16 last year and while that race was large i had never been in a race with as many people as the united airlines half and it was an incredible experience

prerace

the day before the race i was at home having a party for persian new years nowruz and did not go through my typical mental prep routine not that im complaining i stayed over at a relatives apartment in nyc near the race start i woke up at 520 am ate three eggs in the morning and a coffee and i was good to go i also drank a bit of tailwind electrolyte powder before the start i arrived at 607 am and went through a very smooth bag check which was one headache out of the way it was a bit cold at around 30 degrees fahrenheit but far far better weather than my previous two races and finally without rain i got a decent warm up in and the thermal blankets they provided definitely saved me some energy talked to some other runners which was great as always and headed to the start i crossed the start 52 seconds after gun time so i had a decent amount of people in front of me but nothing outrageous 

race

in terms of scenery this was by far the most memorable race ive run going from brooklyn to the manhattan bridge through an empty times square and finishing in central park was absolutely memorizing im happy all the runners in front of me allowed me to slow the pace a bit at the start because i have a bad tendency of going out too fast the hills in prospect park were not nearly as bad as people made them out to be and didnt even compare to the infamous harlem hill in central park that being said the first 45 miles were far more painful then my last race my right leg was in a lot of pain after having run a hard 5 mi two days prior spring track had recently started and as a seniorcaptain i felt that it was necessary to set a good example of hard work for the amazing team i have there are a lot of young runners who i see potential in and i want them to reach their potential finally i decided to tune out the pain and focus on all the times i have felt worse i regularly run in a 8 lmb weighted vest and thought of how heavy it felt finishing 20 miles in that i remembered all the snow ice and wind ive had to run through i looked up at the clear blue sky and felt grateful i didnt have to watch my steps as carefully as my regular night runs the ascent to the top of the manhattan bridge was pretty difficult but then a miracle happened running at my side was a man i met three years ago at my first half marathon in ny he recognized me and we shook hands mid race and bolted down the bridge i ended up picking up the pace a little more and soon found myself going through the roaring crowds of times square the pace was starting to get to me and i slowed down just a bit but i forced myself to finish strong and had a final pace of 558 minmi in the last stretch

postrace

i crossed the line and ran into another runner i met at a local race near where i live back in nj the walk to the exit was long but beautiful a sea of white thermal capes lay before my eyes as i tried to comprehend what i just ran i walked back to the family reunion section to find my parents and aunt waiting for me and embracing me after a long and arduous endeavor im ecstatic that i ran a time qualifier for the nyc marathon and that i prd by over a minute this was the first half marathon ive run out of six in total where i did not place in my age group of 19  under im still so happy that i

springs i was inspired to take this path after having the privilege of running with dean karnazes and krissy moehl in colorado and learning more about the sport through various book on the sport thanks dean karnazes anyway before i get into more ultra training i signed up for a few half marathons because it is currently my favorite distance to run two months ago i ran the nyrr fred lebow half

race ive run going from brooklyn to the manhattan bridge through an empty times square and finishing in central park was absolutely memorizing im happy all the runners in front of me allowed me to slow the pace a bit at the start because i have a bad tendency of going out too fast the hills in prospect park were not nearly as bad as people made them out to be and didnt even compare to the infamous harlem hill in central park that being said the first 45 miles were far more painful then my last race my right leg was in a lot of pain after having run a hard 5 mi two days prior spring track had recently started and as a seniorcaptain i felt that it was necessary to set a good example of hard work for the amazing team i have there are a lot of young runners who i see potential in and i want them to reach their potential finally i decided to tune out the pain and focus on all the times i have felt worse i regularly run in a 8 lmb weighted vest and thought of how heavy it felt finishing 20 miles in that i remembered all the snow ice and wind ive had to run through i looked up at the clear blue sky and felt grateful i didnt have to watch my steps as carefully as my regular night runs the ascent to the top of the manhattan bridge was pretty difficult but then a miracle happened running at my side was a man i met three years ago at my first half marathon in ny he recognized me and we shook hands mid race and bolted down the bridge i ended up picking up the pace a little more and soon found myself going through the roaring crowds of times square the pace was

 training
after completing my 91 qualification for the 2019 nyc marathon at the staten island half back in october i set my sights on running a marathon i knew i didnt want to wait 13 months to make nyc 2019 my first marathon so i looked around for a race happening in early spring within driving distance of nyc the charlottesville marathon was perfect due to proximity to family free place to stay no brainer timing and the fact that it was indeed a marathon admittedly the bar was low and i was just trying to get the first one done with so i could learn from all of my mistakes 

i decided to follow the higdon advanced 1 marathon plan starting in early december with the goal of finishing finishing under 4 hours and a stretch goal of finishing under 35 hours i was consistent with the training and felt solid until one fateful run on a cold january evening where i twisted my ankle and fell down after tripping on a crack in lower manhattan this was the beginning of my ankle bothering me and subsequently the beginning of my achilles tendinitis 

i was able to combat and defeat the tendinitis after weeks of foam rolling rice false starts kinesiology tape and did i mention rice emphasis on the rest this injury combined with training for a marathon outdoors in brooklyn in february made it difficult to stay consistent with the plan i was able to get back on track by march and felt pretty solid about the foundation i stood on by the time race day rolled around

 prerace
we drove down from nyc on friday morning with a quick pit stop in washington dc we stopped in a florida avenue grill where we had some delicious pancakes alongside eggs grits and scrapple afterwards we took a docent tour of the library of congress and walked the national mall to check out the cherry blossoms

we finally made it to charlottesville and i just managed to pick up my bib and shirt as they were closing down the expo for the night instead of waiting for 2 hours to get a meal at tavola we decided to take a chance on firefly where i had an absolutely delicious thai tofu sandwich with a side of kale  onions 

i was in bed by 945 shoutout to our airbnbs amazing casper mattress and up at 5 am ready to race after a pretty great night of sleep

 race
there was no corral system so everyone just congregated around the start line and it wasnt really clear whether or not there were pacers for the race i was slightly annoyed that marathon runners were mixed together with halfmarathon and 8k runners i had spent a lot of time studying the actual turns of the course there are many but i hadnt really registered just how hilly it became during miles 1215 

i had decided ahead of time that i was going to shoot for 8 minute miles during the first 13 miles and reassess the pace for the rest of the race based on how i was feeling at that time as you can see from the timing splits i was feeling too good during the first half of the race i think this is due to the fact that i was running alongside only halfmarathoners and was keeping pace with them however at around mile 9 the full marathon runners broke away from halfers and i found myself alone save for two people about 200 yards ahead of me and one person about 100 yards behind me this is when it got really tough 

i felt strong until mile 16 when i started cramping really badly in hindsight i should have had more of a strategy when it came to gus and proper hydration i dont usually like to take energy gels during a race but id never run a race this distance before and i learned the hard way that they are completely necessary for a marathon i dealt with the cramping until about mile 20 where i was able to meet up with my partner who had gu water and encouragement for me as i was really struggling here the course took us down by rivanna river and the temperature turned noticeably cooler and it was not helpful but as miserable as i was i just focused on continually moving forward even if that meant walking or running at a slower pace as i got closer to the finish i started feeling better and knew i was going to come in under 4 hours which gave me the extra boost i needed to finish

 postrace
i was completely wrecked postrace and immediately knew i hadnt taken in enough water calories or electrolytes during the race this meant i laid on the ground feeling extremely nauseous and put my legs up for about 10 minutes and eventually struggled my way to our car tried drinking as much watergatorade as i could stomach and the thought of solid food made me nauseous after a couple hours of lying down i finally felt well enough to eat like 2000 calories worth of chickfila fuck their politics great chicken on sunday i went on a pretty easy 3 mile hike and felt great

im excited to start training for the nyc marathon and for a few races im going to be doing in the meantime thanks for reading my post

 training
i used hal higdon’s novice half marathon program  with the cold weather here i fell sick about 2 weeks before the race which caused me to miss my last 10 mi long run  but overall i was very consistent with keeping up with the program

 prerace
i woke up at around 530 and took the subway down to prospect park  i arrive about 40 min before my corral closed i budgeted enough time for that 1 mile walk to the start  weather was mid 30s so cool enough not to feel overheated this was my first big run and i was amazed about how many people there were 

 race
overall the race went very well  i know there was a big hill in the beginning of prospect park along with the manhattan bridge up next i was able to make up time in between these two on some flat stretches  i took gels at mile 5 and 9 coming upon the frd drive i met up with the 2 hour pace group and it was nice to actually not have to think about my pace  i had some friends cheer around times square so i sped up ahead of the 2 hour pacer to ensure i didn’t fall behind  as long as i didn’t see the pacer pass me i knew i was good  i had some gas in the tank at around mile 1011 so i picked it up towards the finish 

 postrace
as soon as i stopped i immediately felt soreness in my quads but overall i was proud i finished under 2 hours 

 whats next
with this being run 49 for the 91 program i still have 5 more runs to do to get my guaranteed entry for the 2020 nyc marathon which is my big personal goal

 race strategy

this race was a bit of a spontaneous decision for me but since it was a womens half and easy to get to i decided to sign up my goal race is the run to remember half in boston on may 26th so i went into this wanted to treat it like a fastpaced training run and to save a pr attempt for boston of course i still wanted to go fast but didnt want to overdo it 

i decided id be happy with anything under 2 hours and negative splitting and having even pacing would be a nice plus spoiler alert those last two didnt happen whoops id decided i wanted to be somewhere between my pr 15116 and my second fastest half 15448 and to pace between 820 and 840 miles

 prerace

this race starts in west potomac park which is just off the mall the closest you can get with road closures is the lincoln memorial so its a bit of a walk over to the start i arrived around 615am for the 7am start and they hadnt even called people to the corrals yet so it was a bit of a free for all i had enough space in the corral for a quick warm up it was pouring rain for the majority of the race so i was thrilled to have brought an old heat sheet to ditch in the corral 

the race started right on time and i ended up starting pretty close to the front since the corrals werent sectioned off and there werent many people in the 630730 pace corral i went out just behind the 150 pacer 

 miles 1 to 5

this race was pretty lonely which was good and bad there was a ton of room to run and i wasnt weaving at all however that meant there werent many other runners around in addition to that the course isnt super conducive to spectators so there werent any people on the sides for the first five miles i felt great for the first five around haines point and think i definitely did take it out a bit too fast  like i pretty much always do even though i tell myself i wont it was a bit of a mind trick because im so used to running the cherry blossom 10miler where haines point is the final 3ish miles but for this race it was at the very beginning i had a clif block at miles 3 and 5 which is closer spacing than i usually do my goal for the first five was to have consistent pacing which i think i achieved minus the first mile 

 miles 6 to 10

miles 6 through 10 were an out and back on rock creek parkway so there are some rolling hills and not a ton of spectators i always love seeing the race leaders and looking for my friends so that usually keeps me distracted i had a few friends from november project who were cheering at mile 65 and 10 so that was a great motivation for these miles i was just trying to keep it together to prep for the final miles and keep a good pace

 miles 11 to 13

oh man oh man i have never hit a wall like the wall i hit around mile 11 my legs were heavy my stomach was cramping and the fact that you can see the finish line when you still have two miles to go was more demoralizing than i thought it would be with two miles to go you still have to run around the entirety of the tidal basin i stopped to walk for about 20 seconds to collect myself and gave myself a little pep talk to get to the finish line 

thinking back on this i may have cramped because i didnt space out my fuel every three miles like i usually do and i may have had slightly more water than usual i obviously dont want to hit a wall like that again so any advice you have on avoiding this would be greatly appreciated 

the last mile or so merges with the 8k which started 30 minutes after the half the 8k runners did an ok job at staying out of the half runners path and it looked like there was an attempt by the race organizers to have a separate chute for the 8k runners but it wasnt clearly marked overlap with the 8k was a criticism id heard from this races inaugural year in 2018 so i was happy to see an attempt at keeping the half marathon course open 

 postrace

in the finish line chute there were some water bottles and snacks no heat sheets which im usually indifferent towards but it wouldve been awesome to have one considering everyone was soaked no postrace party since its on the mall but i was happy to keep walking and go over to the course to cheer on the runners still coming in while i waited for my friends 

a half usually does pretty decent damage on my body but after this race i felt surprisingly ok sure my legs are sore but i was still able to go on a shakeout run the next day and stairs arent as difficult as they usually are posthalf 

 whats next

im shooting for a pr at the run to remember half in boston the course is flat my family will be there cheering and hopefully the weather will be slightly more favorable than a rainy day in dc run to remember boston will be my fifth half but id love your input on pacing strategies since i seem to be a bit rusty on getting the pacing correct also if you have any advice on not hitting the wall at the end id super appreciate it 

long term im running marine corps marathon this fall itll be my first full
